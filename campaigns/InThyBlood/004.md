## Rainy night

[Maren](../../directory/Purgare/AltairEnvoys/Maren.md) sleeps at the inn.
The others accept the priest's hospitality and sleep in the Ambrio Chapel.

A man named Hector introduces himself to [Nero Vex](../../directory/Purgare/AltairEnvoys/NeroVex.md).
He complains that the Apocalyptics now hang out in Cavalese, and he preferred it when they were all in Lucatore.
Nero understands that the man is looking for a way to buy Burn.

A thin rain starts late in the night.
It smells of flowers and honey.
Somewhere far away, someone whips something.
Nero steals the golden disk and leaves it in the garden.

## The Cloister

Maren meets the others in the Chapel, and they walk uphill to [the Cloister](../../directory/Purgare/TheCloister/index.md).
At the gate [Lucio](../../directory/Purgare/TheCloister/Lucio.md) and two guards await them.
The two men are the same who started the bar fight the day before.
The group is not allowed to enter with their weapons, so [Neva](../../directory/Purgare/TheCloister/Neva.md) comes and meets them at the gate.

The proud widow explains [Altair](../../directory/Purgare/HouseBenesato/Altair.md) was buried quickly because his wounds were too terrible to be exposed.
She affirms no Anabaptist would have a reason to kill the Baptist: "He was loved by everyone in the Coister."
Neva and Lucio blame [House Benesato](../../directory/Purgare/HouseBenesato/index.md), it was someone under their command.
They don't seek a rational investigation; they want blood.

Nero, who carries Jehameddan's Disk, pretends to be a Jehammedan and offers a ritual at the grave to the brave Altair.
Although unexpected, Neva agrees and sends one of the guards, [Ambroggio](../../directory/Purgare/TheCloister/Ambroggio.md), with them, to the cemetery.
She also agrees to send Pantaleo Batisti, the guard who found Altair's body by the eastern road, to meet Maren at the inn by the end of the day.

All go except Maren, who checks whether her superiors have responded to her earlier message.
Lieutenant Verhoest has radioed:

> "The contraband is not to be prioritised. The oil must flow."

## The Cemetery

As they walk to the cemetery, they see the Elysian Gardens on the northwestern side of the cloister.
Altair's grave is not what [Anastasia](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/Anastasia.md) expects.
Instead of the small stones atop the grave, like in most Anabaptist graves, this one is covered by a single massive boulder.

After a brief chat with Ambroggio, Nero pretends to start a Jehammedan thankful ritual, but they are interrupted.
A drone observes them from the sky.
And then, [Thread](../../directory/Purgare/AltairEnvoys/Thread.md) also sees amber eyes behind a tree.
It is [another Chronicler](../../directory/Purgare/Lucatore/Decoy5.md).

The Chronicler starts running towards the forest to the west.
