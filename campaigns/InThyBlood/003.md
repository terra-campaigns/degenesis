## Heated situation

Inside the [Bleeding Ram](../../directory/Purgare/Lucatore/BleedingRam.md), a group of people drinks early in the afternoon.
[Maren](../../directory/Purgare/AltairEnvoys/Maren.md) does not stay.
As she leaves, two young, strong men enter.
One of them unapologetically bangs his shoulders on the Hellvetic's.

The young [Nero Vex](../../directory/Purgare/AltairEnvoys/NeroVex.md) sits by the bar, inside.
He sees the two men entering, and a drunk spits at their feet.
A heated discussion ensues, but Nero interjects by throwing his drinks in the middle of it.
After a moment of silence and awkwardness, it is clearer who is on each side: it will be 5-to-2.

A bar fight starts, and other patrons leave the bar.
A man at the corner sends his dog to it, which bites randomly, finally stopping the violence.
No one is severely harmed.
Nero speaks with the man, who introduces himself as [Fernex](../../directory/Purgare/Lucatore/Fernex.md).

## Inside House Benesato

[Anastasia](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/Anastasia.md) is invited into [House Benesato](../../directory/Purgare/HouseBenesato/index.md).
[Thread](../../directory/Purgare/AltairEnvoys/Thread.md) follows her, like a boy following his mama.
The visitors walk into a dining room where [Ennio Benesato](../../directory/Purgare/HouseBenesato/EnnioBenesato.md) is having lunch with [Gala Lombardi](../../directory/Purgare/HouseBenesato/GalaLombardi.md).

[Altair](../../directory/Purgare/HouseBenesato/Altair.md) is dead, and Ennio has become the target for all accusations. 
They have no proof. Or do they?
The followers of the Broken Cross really want to pin this on him?
He needs help from benevolent, independent thinkers who can find his brother‘s killer and prove his innocence.

Gala detests the Anabaptists, hates their foolishness, their bad teeth and stinking hair.
Anabaptists are scum.
> "They buried Altair even before his brother could say his farewell!"  
She leaves the table, sick with all of it.

Anastasia agrees to find the killer.
She is given a seal ring to prove her alliance with Ennio.
Ennio promises a thousand dinars if she and her group are successful.

## Plans

Maren uses the few hours to design and convince the guards of a plan to catch [Acilio](../../directory/Purgare/AlpsContrabandRaiders/Acilio.md). 
The guards will radio the trafficker to request supplies and help with fixing a rifle.
If the man is convinced, he should be here in about 3 days.

Happy with her plan, she comes back to the market square.
The [Envoys](../../directory/Purgare/AltairEnvoys/index.md) are together again.
They update each other, and decide to find the Spitalian doctor again.

After a few hours searching, [Carmino Ferro](../../directory/Purgare/Lucatore/CarminoFerro.md) is found inside the distillery.
He comes out to speak with the group and explains again what he had said before:
He was Altair's personal doctor, and he could not see the body after his death.

During the conversation, they notice a drone hovering above them.
The group is not so worried, and neither is Ferro.
> "The Chroniclers are always mapping information."

## The evening starts

Just before sunset, the group visits the Ambrio Chapel.
In it, a priest of the small clan Grigori explains that he has no passion for the Anabaptists, but that he recognises they enriched Lucatore.

While they converse, Vex sees the most valuable treasure ever, on the left wall of the chapel **Jehammed's Disk**.

Anastasia and the two youngsters ask to sleep in the Chapel, and the priest finds them a small room.
The Hellvetic finds herself a room at the Bleeding Ram.
