## Late arrival

The [Altair Envoys](../../directory/Purgare/AltairEnvoys/index.md) arrive at [Lucatore](../../directory/Purgare/Lucatore/index.md) at the end of the day.
The gates are closed.
Outside the walls, they can stay in the Commission House.
A young maidservant, [Dana](../../directory/Purgare/Lucatore/Dana.md), prepares dinner and prepares their bedroom.

In an intimate conversation, Dana shares with [Anastasia](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/Anastasia.md) what she believes.
> "Only the Jehhamedans could have killed Altair. It is belated revenge for the Adriatic wars."

A few hours before sunrise, [Maren](../../directory/Purgare/AltairEnvoys/Maren.md) is awakened to the shouts of a drunken man under her window.
> "(...) the horny old man (...)".
The Grenadier carefully looks and sees the men carrying an Anabaptist Bidenhander.

The man repeats, parts in an unknown dialect.
> "The horny old man has had (...) wants to hand over Lucatore (...) Bergamo family!"

## Early morning

The group enters through the gates as soon as they are opened.
They overhear two Anabaptists commenting, surprised that [Altair](../../directory/Purgare/HouseBenesato/Altair.md) has already been buried.
When they notice Maren and [Kuno](../../directory/Purgare/AltairEnvoys/Kuno.md), they stop them and ask whether they are the Hellvetics sent to look into the defence tower.
Maren and Kuno follow them.

Atop the defence tower, the Hellvetics realise they have been sold contraband Hellvetica ammo.
They are given a name: [Acilio](../../directory/Purgare/AlpsContrabandRaiders/Acilio.md).
Maren apprehends the contraband rounds.
Later, the Alpine soldiers learn that Acilio lives north of the Eden Route, up in the mountains.

Maren and Kuno ask around for a radio station and are led to the water towers.
From there, they send a report to their Alpine command, including findings on the Hellvetica rounds they apprehended.

While at it, Kuno sneakily overhears a heated conversation between a [Spitalian](../../directory/Purgare/Lucatore/CarminoFerro.md) and a [big Anabaptist man](../../directory/Purgare/HouseBenesato/Lucio.md):
> "...tell Emissary Neva that I will find the killer, no matter how!"
The Anabaptist is soon called to the wall and leaves the Spitalian by himself.

Kuno approaches the Spitalian, who introduces himself as Carmino Ferro.
He was the personal doctor of Altair, and he is enraged that his patient was buried without his autopsy.
He also mentions he was supposed to meet Altair in Vivaco, on the morning of his death, but the Baptist did not come.

## In the Market Square

A wide courtyard stretches in front of the Home of the [Benesato](../../directory/Purgare/HouseBenesato/index.md) family.
An hour later, [Thread](../../directory/Purgare/AltairEnvoys/Thread.md) stands in the middle of the square.
While he searches for something, he finds what he is not looking for.

The Anabaptist who was speaking with Ferro stops in front of the small Chronicler.
They both seem to be looking for something else that is not in front of them.
The Anabaptist, quicker to realise this was not going anywhere, moves on.

[Anastasia](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/Anastasia.md) introduces herself to the doorman of House Benesato.
She impresses the man with her conduct, but unfortunately, he cannot invite her to speak with the head of the family, [Ennio Benesato](../../directory/Purgare/Lucatore/EnnioBenesato.md).
Anastasia is promised she will be called for a meeting with Ennio later that same day.

As the Cossack approaches Thread, they both overhear a Benesato family member, this time an old weaver called Miranda Benesato.
> "Before the Broken Cross came, my Clan was decent and honourable. Only Ennio can restore our dignity."

At that moment, Anastasia and Thread looked like a small family in the middle of the square.
They can see the two large Hellvetics, their new companions, entering the local inn, the [BleedingRam](../../directory/Purgare/Lucatore/BleedingRam.md).
