An improbable group is formed.
Unknown to them, they are called the [Altair Envoys](../../directory/Purgare/AltairEnvoys/index.md).

[Maren](../../directory/Purgare/AltairEnvoys/Maren.md), a Hellvetics Granadier, takes a leadership position.
[Kuno](../../directory/Purgare/AltairEnvoys/Kuno.md), her junior in the cult, a Hellvetics Corporal, follows her orders to the letter.
They have their orders.
This is not an investigation, but damage control: the Elysian Oils have to continue to flow, for the sake of the Alp's businesses.

Accompanying them, [IO](../../directory/Purgare/AltairEnvoys/IO.md), a Chronicler Agent, and [Thread](../../directory/Purgare/AltairEnvoys/Thread.md), a Chronicler Bit.
The chroniclers are tasked with understanding the plot behind Altair's murder.
Information is money.

[Anastasia](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/Anastasia.md) was just passing through.
The assassination interested her.
She has not shared her goals yet.

At the halfway point of the first day of travel to [Lucatore](../../directory/Purgare/NorthernPurgare/Lucatore.md), the Envoys approach a checkpoint cabin.
A Hellvetics Soldier relaxes inside.
He had orders to go to Lucatore for equipment inspection, but decided to stop here when a scout brought the news of Altair's murder.
Maren commands the young man to carry out his orders.

One hour later, further in the road, the group notices they are being observed by a drone.
Maren shoots it down, and IO investigates its components.
Half an hour further, the same young Hellvetic is found shot dead, with a poison dart.

IO hypothesise it could have been shot from the drone.
The others search, with no success, for the marksman's trail.
