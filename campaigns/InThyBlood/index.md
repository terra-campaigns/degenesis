# In Thy Blood

**BAPTIST ALTAIR HAS BEEN MURDERED IN PURGARE.**

Baptist Altair was important for your Cult.
You were not told why.
You have been sent to [Northern Purgare](NorthernPurgare.md) to investigate his death.

You have been told that Baptist Altair is important for other Cults, too.
It is expected that other emissaries would be sent alongside you.
The order is to get to know them and work together.
But don't trust everyone.

You were given one rumour as a starting point.
