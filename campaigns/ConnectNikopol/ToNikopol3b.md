### Early Morning

- The [Clique](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/index.md) begins the day before dawn, loading the cars under a solemn atmosphere. [Isolde Pax](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/IsoldePax.md) leads an Anabaptist prayer, imbuing the moment with quiet reverence.
- [Konrad Jager](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/KonradJager.md), [Elara Nyx](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/ElaraNyx.md), [Marcus Voss](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/MarcusVoss.md) and Isolde board a car laden with grain. [Yelena](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/Yelena.md), a Cossack curious and awestruck by the group, joins them on their journey.
- [Dexter](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/Dexter.md) exchanges a knowing glance with [Purifier Harlem](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/PurifierHarlem.md), tasked with ensuring the cars are secure. However, he locks the group inside their car.
- Elara manages to flag down a Spitalian inspecting nearby cars. The Spitalian retrieves a key and frees the group, averting disaster.

### A Loaded Day

- The train enters the surreal, alien expanse of the Spore Wall’s mycelium. The atmosphere within the car grows tense and heavy with dread.
- In the dim confines of their car, Konrad and Marcus resume their ongoing game from previous days, the weight of their journey evident in their subdued demeanour.
- Yelena consumes Bion, a Burn strain from Pollen, openly. The group refrains from criticising her actions.
- Konrad develops a rash in one eye, a condition Elara recognises as a cultural stigma. She quietly resolves to treat it upon their arrival in Nikopol.

### Ambush

- Without warning, the train halts. [Husk Spiders](../../creatures/HuskSpiderSwarm.md) swarm the cars, while [Migrants](../../creatures/Migrants.md) seize the moment to attack, slashing through soldiers venturing into the mycelium.
- Marcus charges toward the front of the train, Konrad and Elara following closely. They find the tracks ahead sabotaged, leaving the signal car unable to proceed. [Commando Prime Klaus](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/ComPrimeKlaus.md) orders the group to protect the Storksis unit making the repairs.
- A Migrant abomination advances. Marcus, wielding his bidenhander, confronts it and slays the creature. Yet, something goes awry—Marcus turns on a group of Cossacks rushing to help. They retaliate, gunning him down. Marcus’s life ends amidst the Spore Wall’s haunting fungal mist.
- The Clique retreats back to the relative safety of the wagons, while fungicide is deployed to stem the Migrants’ encroachment.

### Arrival in Nikopol

- By nightfall, the battered Clique reaches [index](../../gazetteer/Pollen/Nikopol/index.md).
- The cost of the ambush is devastating—one in every three members have perished, and many others are gravely wounded.
- The group undergoes a gruelling decontamination process, treated like infected animals by figures in environmental suits.

- Isolde gathers Marcus’s belongings, preparing to honour him with a proper burial.
- She finds a sketch of a forbidden fruit from the fractal forest on the last page of Marcus' drawing book.
