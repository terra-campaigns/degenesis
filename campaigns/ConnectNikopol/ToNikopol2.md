### Arrival in [Cherasky](../../gazetteer/Pollen/Cherasky.md)

- The [Clique](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/index.md) gathers under [Commando Prime Klaus](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/ComPrimeKlaus.md), whose orders resonate with discipline and necessity—clearing frozen mud from the tracks begins.
- [Inquisitor Thorne](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/InquisitorThorne.md), [Isolde Pax](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/IsoldePax.md), [Dr. Moreau](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/DrMoreau.md), [Marcus Voss](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/MarcusVoss.md) and [Konrad Jager](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/KonradJager.md) go to the eastern tracks.
- Marcus sketches Klaus, capturing the grit of leadership etched in lines and shadow.
- They accompany a Storskis, who is responsible for driving and operating the cleaning car.

### Encounter at a Fractal Forest

- Seven Anabaptists stumble from a [Fractal Forest](https://discord.com/channels/1060840338777964565/1288248721322020926/1307719825501589515), intoxicated by its alien fruit, their delirium betraying their faith.
- Isolde Pax’s flames purge their sin; the forest echoes with screams as judgment rains fire. Dr. Monroe and Marcus ensure no escape, leaving ashes and blood behind.

### The Storskis’ Ritual

- The Storksis halts the cleaning car at an ancestral graveyard, a site steeped in memory and the hum of prayers.
- Dr. Monroe joins the rites in silent respect, the weight of history pressing upon the group.
- In whispered tones, Isolde and Marcus confront their earlier violence, tethering their souls with justification: “They were sinners.”

### Final Day’s Travel, before [Shard](../../gazetteer/Pollen/Shard.md)

- The tracks ease their grip, their frozen defiance replaced by fleeting respite as the group advances.
- Rain turns to hail, then an uncanny downpour of insect fragments, culminating in a living storm of spiders.
- Spiders weave a gossamer shroud over the land but spare the travellers, leaving them as untouched witnesses to nature’s alien will.
