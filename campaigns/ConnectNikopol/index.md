## Campaign objectives

> As established [before crossing the spore wall](https://terra-campaigns.github.io/degenesis/campaigns/ConnectNikopol/ToNikopol3a/#the-cliques-mission-in-nikopol).

- Unearth any connections the enigmatic city may have to [Vasco](https://degenesis.com/world/bio/spitalians/vasco)’s mystery—a ghost haunting Spitalian politics.
- Probe [index](../../gazetteer/Pollen/Nikopol/index.md)’s underbelly, seeking to smuggle [Kievan](../../gazetteer/Pollen/Kiev.md) artefacts through the Storskis rail, their path destined for the Protectorate’s coffers.
- Twist the city's leadership into vassals of the Protectorate—or, failing that, identify and nurture a new [Rarogi](../../systems/backgrounds/rarogi.md) power that bends more easily to the Protectorate's will.
