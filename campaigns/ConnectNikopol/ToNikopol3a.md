### A Compelled Exchange

- [Isolde Pax](../../people/ProtectorateClique/IsoldePax.md) and [Konrad Jager](../../people/ProtectorateClique/KonradJager.md) watch in silence as Dexter, a seasoned [Dexter](../../people/ProtectorateClique/Dexter.md), and [Purifier Harlem](../../people/ProtectorateClique/PurifierHarlem.md) engage in a cryptic trade.
- The supposed transaction closes, and Dexter, now clutching a rare Kievan artefact, confronts a young Cossack woman who shouts in a desperate voice: "But I don't want [Nikopol](../../locations/Nikopol.md) rates, I wish to sell it in the [Protectorate](https://degenesis.com/world/stories/borca/justitian)"
- Naively, Konrad interjects. What follows is chaos—a scuffle that ends with Isolde sprawled in the dirt, her nose shattered. Dexter vanishes into the shadows, the artefact secure in his grip.

### The Clique's Mission in Nikopol

[Commando Prime Klaus](../../people/ProtectorateClique/ComPrimeKlaus.md) assembles his loyal Clique, his words heavy with purpose and veiled warnings. The mission unfolds:

- Unearth any connections the enigmatic city may have to [Vasco](https://degenesis.com/world/bio/spitalians/vasco)’s mystery—a ghost haunting Spitalian politics.
- Probe Nikopol’s underbelly, seeking to smuggle Kievan artefacts through the Storskis rail, their path destined for the Protectorate’s coffers.
- Twist the city's leadership into vassals of the Protectorate—or, failing that, identify and nurture a new power that bends more easily to the Protectorate's will.
