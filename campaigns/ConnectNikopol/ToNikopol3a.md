### A forced trade

- [Isolde Pax](../../people/ProtectorateClique/IsoldePax.md) and [Konrad Jager](../../people/ProtectorateClique/KonradJager.md) observe [Dexter](Dexter.md), a Scrapper from the Clique, and [Purifier Harlem](PurifierHarlem.md) exchanging notes - was it Chronicler Drafts?
- The Scrapper comes back and forces a trade of a Kievan artefact from a young Cossack woman: "But I don't want [Nikopol](Nikopol.md) rates, I wish to sell it in the Protectorate"
- Konrad, naively, intersects the deal and a kerfuffle ensues. Isolde is bested by the Scrapper, and leaves with a broken nose.

### The Clique mission in Nikopol

[Commando Prime Klaus](../../people/ProtectorateClique/ComPrimeKlaus.md) gathers the entire Clique and details the expedition mission in Nikopol:

- Collect information on any relationship or influence the city had on the mystery of [Vasco](https://youtu.be/pPO9amOJlDQ?si=HAAWmsYymGoehv_9).
- Understand why, and possibly establish a smuggling route, so that Kievan artefacts can reach the Protectorate through the Storskis rail.
- Influence the city leadership to become vassals of the Protectorate, or find a new leadership that would.
