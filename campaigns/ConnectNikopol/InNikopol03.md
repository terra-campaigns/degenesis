### Preamble 

[Friedrich](../../people/ProtectorateClique/FriedrichVoigt.md) had plenty to drink as he listened and learned more about the Streltsys. They believed the Spitalians used the story of Vasco as a mere excuse to sever their old alliance with Nikopol—after all, Vasco had only passed through the city years ago and was nothing of significance. There had to be another motive. When asked about the artefacts, the Streltsys admitted they knew little but suggested speaking with a trader named Orest. As for the fleshy thing in the Bloody Mines, they revealed it wasn’t new; they had heard of it before, yet Elder Ivan had never truly addressed it.

[Sasha](../../people/ProtectorateClique/SashaVolkov.md) joined Friedrick and the Streltsys for drinks, listening closely to their thoughts. They had no idea where Wren might have gone, but as an Apocalyptic, he knew how to navigate the city’s underbelly. He could easily evade Nikopol’s guards and slip back to the Apocalyptic Manor. If he was still around, he was likely hiding there, waiting for Sokolov to place a new Burn stash order.

[Jorn](../../people/FoundersBlessed/JornKal.md) opened up to [Thaddeus](../../people/ProtectorateClique/ThaddeusCain.md), sharing his frustrations. He had arrived in Nikopol with his platoon, expecting a promotion after proving himself. But in January, five months ago, everything fell apart. Their expedition was ambushed—first by swarms of spiders and centipedes, then by Leperos. Forced into retreat, they barely lasted four days before a Biokinetic found them and wiped out the platoon. Jorn survived, recovering just enough to make one last attempt at Spitalian glory. He declared an embargo on Nikopol and seized a large Burn stash from the Apocalyptic Manor, but it was all for nothing. No one cared anymore—the Spital had already turned its back on the city.

[Isolde](../../people/ProtectorateClique/IsoldePax.md) spent two days drinking with the off-duty Streltsys, reminding them that Anabaptists were no strangers to holding their liquor. Her endurance earned their respect, and some even invited her to join their order, impressed by both her skill in the field and her prowess with a glass. Among them, she befriended Pavlo, a slacker when it came to his duties but highly curious about the Clique.

[Anastasia](../../people/ProtectorateClique/Anastasia.md) reads the train logs. There is nothing out of the ordinary, except that one cargo was marked with `dried meat` but used a steel crate, and took a long time to load. It was a special export to Africa, sent by Elder Ivan. Other details were redacted, but she could scratch some of the ink and recognise the word `ANSUMO`.

During quarantine, Myron had several private meetings with her boss, [Prokhor](../../people/FoundersBlessed/Prokhor.md). She tells that Anastasia will be granted a meeting with the Leperos woman, [Mirova](../../people/Vostok/mirova.md), but that Prokhor would also expect a meeting with Anastasia's group in the next few days.

### Friends

[Sublime Pax](../../people/ProtectorateClique/IsoldePax.md) comes to meet her Clique companions as they leave quarantine with the Streltsys. The group has a chat, standing on one of the [Nikopol](../../locations/Nikopol.md)’s corridors with metal walls installed on rock, new and bygone graffiti covered metal plates screwed directly on rock walls. They feel relaxed and friendly, except maybe for [Elder Anastasia](../../people/ProtectorateClique/Anastasia.md) and [Surgeon Friedrich](../../people/ProtectorateClique/FriedrichVoigt.md) – who feel antagonistic on how to deal with people infected by Sepsis.

[Dexter](../../people/ProtectorateClique/Dexter.md) approaches and makes a joke about Konrad, before offering his condolences to Isolde and Friedrick. His handshake offer is met by Isolde’s punch on his stomach. He is told off by the Anabaptist Sublime and leaves the area grunting.

The group of friends briefly discuss what could be best for Yelena. They are worried about her, specially [Sasha Volkov](../../people/ProtectorateClique/SashaVolkov.md), after all she has been through. But other responsibilities take precedence, and they decide to pay a visit to [Lubos](../../people/FoundersBlessed/Lubos.md).

### Lubos’ workshop

Lubos greeted them with happiness in his face, although showing a limp and a blackened eye. As they talk with the Borcan Steel Master, they understand that he has been brought to Nikopol in conditions of slavery. As he becomes aware of his situation, he gets increasingly more stressed and starts shaking.

While most are chatting in a corner, Friedrick uses the opportunity to look at some of the artefact crates: electric toothbrushes, popcorn makers, a Harley Davidson – and daydream of a life he could have elsewhere, far from all the conflict and pain.

Before leaving, Lubos feels courageous and shows them his work. In a corner on the back of the workshop, a pile of robots have been disassembled, and one single robot stands, fully armoured and with wiring being installed. A bygone ANSUMO.

### After-hours

[Aaron](../../people/ProtectorateClique/AaronPartow.md) is thrilled by the workshop and eagerly asks about the ANSUMO, but Lubos admits he knows little about the robots and that the workshop is a well-hidden secret. Aaron offers to help repair the machines in exchange for a workspace, but Lubos warns that Elder Ivan must approve. Friedrich cautions Aaron that exposing the secret could put Lubos in danger, making the situation even more delicate.

Sasha wonders if [Bodgan 'Detina'](../../people/FoundersBlessed/BodganDetina.md), like Lubos, had a contract and if he could be recruited into the Clique. Off-duty and drinking, Bogdan is irritated at the thought of more work and assumes Sasha is just passing through. But when reminded of Yelena, he agrees to watch over her during his free time. Sasha clasps his hand, telling him to guard her with his life, then shares a drink with him. They toast: "To our health!"
