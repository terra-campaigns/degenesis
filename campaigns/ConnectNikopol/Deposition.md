### A quiet dinner

The mess hall is empty.
A strange feeling—will the Primer answer the violence?
The Streltsys are celebrating at the station.
There are no miners in the hall, only the [Clique](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/index.md) is there.

[Varvara Semyonich](../../gazetteer/Pollen/FoundersBlessed/VarvaraSemyonich.md) survived the ambush.
She tries to befriend the Spitalians first.
[Commando Prime Klaus](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/ComPrimeKlaus.md) is lost in thought.
[Erasmus Kline](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/ErasmusKline.md) tries to find a way to act.

[Anastasia](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/Anastasia.md) speaks with [Mirova](../../gazetteer/Pollen/Vostok/mirova.md).
Where are the other Cossacks?
[Sokolov](../../gazetteer/Pollen/FoundersBlessed/Sokolov.md) arrives for dinner.
He is unhappy with something—his supply?

Shouts and hurdles.
Someone is being taken somewhere on a neighbour tunnel.
The group does not see who.

### Shut off

As Commando Primes leaves the room, miners take the corridors with large steel plates and rods.
Varvara knows they are locking the city—making a fortress of it.
Are they under an external threat?

Someone tells Anastasia the truth: The Cossacks will make the [rouge Spitalians](Brochovs.md) pay.
They are in the station depot and still in quarantine.

Erasmus follows Commando Prime.
Varvara goes to one of the gates, to help block it.
Anastasia takes Mirova and they go to the station depot.
They run towards the northeast exit.

### Awaken

[Lubos](../../gazetteer/Pollen/FoundersBlessed/Lubos.md) runs towards them.
The [ANSUMO](InNikopol03.md) has awakened.
It is building something with the batteries.
It is fast.

Erasmus goes with Varvara to the exit.
He wants to learn how to open it if the Clique needs it.

In a closed tunnel, sounds of skirmish.
Erasmus goes to check it.
The ANSUMO has spanked two miners and now runs to the east.
Is it following Anastasia?

On the way to the depot, another exit is being sealed.
The ANSUMO turns to it and punches the barricade down.
The machine-man leaves Nikopol.

### Execution

Anastasia arrives at the depot.
The Cossacks are performing a revenge ritual, where each cuts a bit the rogue Spitalians.
Anastasia blesses their decision.
She gives the final blows.

Erasmus follows the path the ANSUMO has taken.
What did he leave behind?

At the workshop, Rayina sleeps.
As she is woken up, she hears some faint electronic sound.
They find a battery bomb.
It will go kaboom.

Commando Prime gathers the troops.
The bomb goes off with a strong and muffled sound.
The tunnels tremble.

### Dethroning 

A miner brings a message to the Clique.
Their leadership is being summoned in the deep tunnels.
Commando Prime sends Erasmus and Anastasia.
Varvars follows.

[Vira](../../gazetteer/Pollen/FoundersBlessed/Vira.md) holds [Elder Ivan](../../gazetteer/Pollen/FoundersBlessed/IvanTheWise.md), who pleads for his freedom.
Erasmus decided not to stop the miners.
Ivan is killed on the spot, a flintlock pistol headshot.

[Nikopol](../../locations/Nikopol.md) is now for the people.
The Streltsys are locked outside and will perish.
New rulers.
With the Clique, or not.
