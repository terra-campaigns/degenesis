**A detachment from the Protectorate Clique is tasked to scout the way to the ruins of [Cherasky](../../locations/Cherasky.md).**

-	[IsoldePax](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/IsoldePax.md), an Anabaptist Furor woman who believed this mission to be blessed.
-	Ignatius Volker, an Spitalian Femulancer man.
-	Researcher [ElaraNyx](../../gazetteer/Pollen/ProtectorateClique/ElaraNyx.md), an Spitalian Femulancer woman.

**The first two days bring good omens.**

-	The terrible gossamer and wasteland give way to a light grassland, with easy to find campgrounds.
-	The chilly spring weather warms up and nice days with clear nights are welcomed by the scouts.
-	In one of the campgrounds, they find traces of previous travellers, children’s clothes and footprints of a few teenagers. Ignatius and Elara’s mollusk tremble, indicating presence of Primer matter.

**The following days see worsening weather, and the region is washed out by torrential rain which turns into snow as the temperature continue to drop.**

-	Camping on mud does not allow the scouts to rest well.
-	During Ignatius watch, three teenagers approach the camp, and the mollusk again spasms. They try to greet Ignatius, who intimidate them to go away from under his mask.
-	Ignatius does not mention the encounter to his companions.

**Travelling through mud and snow, tired, Isolde prays with fervour for their endurance – and she seems to be heard.**

-	A sole Fruit from a Fractal Forest is found, laying down on dry soil. Ignatius takes it but is convinced to give it to Isolde.
-	As the group observes the fruit, flames ablaze what looks like a Fractal Forest in the northeast.
-	The three scouts are not distracted, and finish their march, arriving at the empty ruins of Cherasky.
