| **1,1** | **The AMNESIAC:** does not remember their past.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **1,2** | **The ADVENTURER** is a restless soul, forever chasing the edge of the map and the thrill of the unknown, where fear is not an enemy but a trusted ally. For them, the dull weight of routine is a death knell, and only in the shadow of forgotten ruins and the depths of uncharted passages do they feel alive. **What drives you forward when the ruins are silent and the darkness offers no answers?**                              |
| **1,3** | **The CREATOR** defies the inevitable decay of all things, driven to craft enduring monuments that preserve their name and legacy against the sands of time. They work tirelessly to master the grandest challenges, whether building monoliths, fortifying villages, or rekindling the Stream, each creation a testament to their worth. **What compels you to keep building when the world itself seems intent on erasing everything?** |
| **1,4** | **The MENTOR** is the bridge between past and future, immortalising themselves by instilling knowledge and curiosity into chosen disciples. They cultivate understanding, shaping minds to carry their work forward and uphold the cycle of learning that elevates humanity. **How do you protect the flame of knowledge that the world threatens to extinguish?**                                                                        |
| **1,5** | **The MARTYR** finds strength in sacrifice, standing unwavering where others falter, their actions a beacon of resolve and unyielding faith. They charge into the storm, armoured by principles that inspire hope and shield the vulnerable, refusing to surrender even in the face of despair. **When the weight of sacrifice becomes unbearable, what will keep you moving forward?**                                                   |
| **1,6** | **The RULER** is a master of order, wielding control as both shield and blade to tame the chaos of a disobedient world. They bear the burden of leadership, holding tight to the reins of power and making decisions that others dare not, fearing the ruin that delegation might bring. **When the weight of control becomes too great, who is the only one you will trust?**                                                            |
| **2,1** | **The SEEKER** is consumed by questions of existence, driven to unravel the mysteries of the past and present before time slips away. They delve into forgotten ruins and cutting-edge labs, dissecting enigmas to uncover truths no one else dares to seek. **When the answers remain elusive, where do you go to uncover the secrets of the world?**                                                                                    |
| **2,2** | **The HEALER** battles tirelessly against the world's collapse, mending broken bodies, barren soil, and shattered minds with relentless care.

| **2,3** | **The TRADITIONALIST** clings to the past, finding safety and meaning in ancient rules that shield humanity from chaos and anarchy.

| **2,5** | **The HERMIT** shuns the noise of the world, finding solace in solitude and freedom in the absence of responsibility to others. They retreat to the fringes, content to live alone, untouched by the chatter and stories of those they disdain. **When the world intrudes on their peace, how do you fight to remain isolated?**                                                                                                          |
| **2,6** | **The HERETIC** thrives on doubt, tearing down sacred beliefs and questioning the foundations of rules and traditions. They revel in rebellion and chaos, seeking to shatter civilisation’s stagnant ideals and lead others into defiance. **When their actions ignite the fires of revolution, you embrace the destruction or guide what rises from the ashes?**                                                                         |
| **3,1** | **The CONQUEROR** thrives in the clash of powers, seeing every struggle as a chance to dominate and every choice as a step toward victory. Fuelled by unshakable hubris, they scoff at modesty and morality, believing only triumph defines worth. **When their victories bred enemies and isolation, how did you failed your own ambition?**                                                                                             |
| **3,2** | **The ABOMINATION** is a shadow of humanity, broken and twisted, thriving on the unease and terror he ignites in others. He revels in their fear, lost in his own madness and fantasies, a feral beast unbound by compassion or responsibility. **When the ticking bomb inside you threatens to explode, how do you embrace the chaos?**                                                                                                  |
| **3,3** | **The DESTROYER** is chaos incarnate, driven by the belief that only through annihilation can something new arise. Consumed by madness, he sees enemies everywhere, relentlessly pursuing and eradicating them, never pausing to witness what grows in his wake. **When there is nothing left to destroy, what will drive you forward?**                                                                                                  |
| **3,4** | **The CHOSEN** walks the world wrapped in the mantle of destiny, believing himself the answer to every question and the saviour for all who follow. His words inspire fervor, casting him as a messiah to some and a fraud to others, whom he damns for their disbelief. **When the weight of expectation grows unbearable, who helps you fulfil your destiny?**                                                                          |
| **3,5** | **The DEFILER** seethes with envy, unable to bear the joy, beauty, or strength of others, finding purpose only in tearing them down. He thrives in sowing discord and misery, dragging others into the muck to reflect his own turmoil. **When the dust settles and nothing remains, what is the one thing you can never destroy?**                                                                                                       |
| **3,6** | **The PROTECTOR** is a steadfast guardian, standing like an unyielding tower before the treasures he holds dear, whether people, artefacts, or ideas. His purpose is preservation, dedicating his life to shielding what matters most, even at the cost of his own. **You carry a Shield, and have sworn to protect someone - who?**                                                                                                      |
| **4,1** | **The VISIONARY** peers beyond the veil of time, his mind grasping the threads of the future as he strives to guide humanity toward a brighter destiny. With intellect and foresight, he implores reason and challenges disbelief, paving the way for progress through unwavering conviction. **When the world resists your vision, what do you do?**                                                                                     |
| **4,2** | **The ZEALOT** burns with unwavering devotion, drawing strength from a faith so fierce it scorches everything in its path. He endures suffering and sacrifices all for his religion or ideology, proving his worth through relentless acts of belief. **When the fire consumes all but your faith, what will remain to guide you?**                                                                                                       |
| **4,3** | **The DISCIPLE** is a wanderer on the endless ocean of knowledge, forever pursuing forgotten truths and the wisdom of the Bygones. Though rich in learning and diverse in skills, his insatiable curiosity leaves him unable to settle on a single path. **When faced with the need to choose, how do you continue drifting in search of more?**                                                                                          |
| **4,4** | **The RIGHTEOUS** walks a path of unyielding moral clarity, dividing the world into absolutes of good and evil, guided by a pure conscience. Judging all without hesitation or doubt, he sees himself as the arbiter of faith and law, enforcing his vision of justice at every turn. **When his righteousness is challenged, what makes you hold steadfast to your beliefs?**                                                            |
| **4,5** | **The TRAVELER** is a restless soul, forever seeking growth through the vast tapestry of the world and its people, sharing stories and news as he forges connections between the isolated and the civilized. Each step along the road fuels his longing for the next, carrying both joy and despair to those he meets. **When the road offers no new horizons, how do you forge a path into the unknown?**                                |
| **4,6** | Roll twice and combine the bonds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
