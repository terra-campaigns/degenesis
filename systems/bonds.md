| **1,1** | **The AMNESIAC** does not remember their past.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **1,2** | **The ADVENTURER** is a restless soul, forever chasing the edge of the map and the thrill of the unknown, where fear is not an enemy but a trusted ally. For them, the dull weight of routine is a death knell, and only in the shadow of forgotten ruins and the depths of uncharted passages do they feel alive. **What drives you forward when the ruins are silent and the darkness offers no answers?**                              |
| **1,3** | **The CREATOR** defies the inevitable decay of all things, driven to craft enduring monuments that preserve their name and legacy against the sands of time. They work tirelessly to master the grandest challenges, whether building monoliths, fortifying villages, or rekindling the Stream, each creation a testament to their worth. **What compels you to keep building when the world itself seems intent on erasing everything?** |
| **1,4** | **The MENTOR** is the bridge between past and future, immortalising themselves by instilling knowledge and curiosity into chosen disciples. They cultivate understanding, shaping minds to carry their work forward and uphold the cycle of learning that elevates humanity. **How do you protect the flame of knowledge that the world threatens to extinguish?**                                                                        |
| **1,5** | **The MARTYR** finds strength in sacrifice, standing unwavering where others falter, their actions a beacon of resolve and unyielding faith. They charge into the storm, armoured by principles that inspire hope and shield the vulnerable, refusing to surrender even in the face of despair. **When the weight of sacrifice becomes unbearable, what will keep you moving forward?**                                                   |
