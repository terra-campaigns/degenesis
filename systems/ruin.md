# Sepsis

When you are exposed to the primer, or take [Burn](https://degenesis.com/world/stories/apocalyptics/burn-baby-burn), you suffer [Spore Infestation](https://degenesis.com/world/stories/pollen/sepsis).
Environment suits and masks reduce the impact of **Spore Infestation**, analog to how Armour does for combat.
**Spore Infestation** reduces **WIL**.

If though a **Spore Infestation** your **WIL** becomes equal or lower than your **Fatigue**, a cultural stigma blooms.
Look up the amount of **WIL** lost on the table below, and then roll on the adequate [Sepsis Mutation](#sepsis-mutations) table.
As your cultural stigma fades away, your mutation manifests.
The development is complete when your **WIL** is recovered fully.
Increase your minimum **Fatigue** in 1.

|        |                                                 |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **1**  | Roll on the favourable mental mutation table    |
| **2**  | Roll on the favourable physical mutation table  |
| **3**  | Roll on the detrimental mental mutation table   |
| **4+** | Roll on the detrimental physical mutation table |

## Sporination

| ------- | --------------------------------- |
| **d4**  | Equivalent to a daily dose Burn   |
| **d6**  | Spore mist in hi-risk zones       |

| **d10** | Sporination in mother spore field |
| **d12** | Sporination in the Earth Chakras  |

#### Note

The amount and frequency of how you deal Primer infection establishes the tone and pacing of your game.
It is a dial to control how fast characters change.
The recommendation is to deal the values above once per day, when characters are exposed.

## Types of Burn

Different types of Burn are harvested depending on Earth Chakra proximity.

| **BION** | Pollen brings cold and hunger, while **Bion** offers warmth and comfort. One deep breath from the goat skin connects the person to the land, revitalising them with cold winds and minimal sustenance as their body fills with life force. | The Burner shakes off illness and poison, feels no cold or hunger. Effect lasts one day and removes the Deprived condition. |
