# Character Development

Characters are deepened through narrative and play.
The more you play your characters, the more they are defined as people.

Primal Odd contains three reward mechanics that incentivise engagement with the world.

1. Through engagement with factions in the story, and by making bold decisions, your PC advances in your [Cult or Clan](../#backgrounds) ranks. This progresses your PC's importance in the world (narrative benefit) and gives you access to specific equipment (mechanical benefit). On the other hand, you become exposed to higher political risks.
2. Through engagement with violence you may get [Scars](../#scars). Scars support attribute and HP increases. On the other hand, you become exposed to direct risk of death.
3. Through engagement with the environmental catastrophe (the Primer) you develop [Sepsis](../#sepsis). Accumulated Sepsis drive mutations, which can be beneficial or detrimental. The more mutations you have, the more likely you are to loose your PC to the Primer.
