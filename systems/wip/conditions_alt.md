# Conditions

> Replaces [Deprivation & Fatigue](https://terra-campaigns.github.io/degenesis/systems/#deprivation--fatigue)

## Deprivation

- A PC that lacks a crucial need (such as food or rest in a safe spot) is **Deprived**.
- A **Deprived** PC cannot recover HP, Attributes, or from **Fatigue**.

## Fatigue

- Anyone **Deprived** for more than a day adds **Fatigue** to their Burdens, one for each day. A PC may also gain **Fatigue** after using **Potentials** or due to events occurring in the fiction.
- Each **Fatigue** occupies one Burden slot and lasts until the PC is able to recuperate (such as with a full night’s rest in a safe spot).
- If a character is forced to add **Fatigue** to their Burdens but they have no free slots, they must drop an item from their inventory.

## Panic

- A character that is surrounded by enemies, enveloped by darkness, or facing their greatest fears may experience _Panic_. A **WIL** **save** is typically required to avoid losing control and becoming _panicked_.
- When you *panic*, the GM may ask you what uncontrollable reaction you take.
- A _panicked_ character must make a **WIL** **save** to overcome their condition as an **action** on their **turn**.
- A _panicked_ character has 0 **HP**, does not act in the first round of combat, and all of their attacks are _impaired_.
