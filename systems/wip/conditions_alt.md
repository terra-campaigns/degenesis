# Deprivation & Fatigue (alternative rule)

- A PC that lacks a crucial need (such as food or rest in a safe spot) is **Deprived**. Anyone **Deprived** for more than one day loses **1 WIL** a day. A **Deprived** PC cannot recover HP or Attributes.
- When the rules mention a PC gains **Fatigue** (after using **Potentials** or due to events occurring in the fiction) they lose **1 WIL**.
