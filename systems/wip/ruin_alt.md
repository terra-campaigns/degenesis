# Sepsis (Alternative Rule)

When you are exposed to the primer, or take [Burn](https://degenesis.com/world/stories/apocalyptics/burn-baby-burn), you suffer [Spore Infestation](https://degenesis.com/world/stories/pollen/sepsis).
Environment suits and masks reduce the impact of **Spore Infestation**, analog to how Armour does for combat,
i.e. they reduce the die result before evaluating the consequences.
If the remaining **Spore Infestation** is greater than **0**, compare it with your current **WIL**.

|           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **< WIL** | Reduce the remaining **Spore Infestation** from your current **WIL**.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **= WIL** | Re-roll your maximum **WIL** with **3d6** and keep the new result if lower. If your maximum **WIL** was reduced you gain a **Favourable [Mutation](#sepsis-mutations)**, otherwise you gain a **Detrimental [Mutation](#sepsis-mutations)**. |
| **> WIL** | You develop a **Cultural Stigma** that goes away when your **WIL** is fully recovered. If you already had a **Cultural Stigma** your lungs fill with snot and you choke. You become **Deprived**.                                            |
