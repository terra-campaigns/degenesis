# Sepsis (Alternative Rule)

When you are exposed to the primer, or take [Burn](https://degenesis.com/world/stories/apocalyptics/burn-baby-burn), you suffer [Spore Infestation](https://degenesis.com/world/stories/pollen/sepsis).
Environment suits and masks reduce the impact of **Spore Infestation**, analog to how Armour does for combat,
i.e. they reduce the die result before evaluating the consequences.
If the remaining **Spore Infestation** is greater than **0**, compare it with your current **WIL**.

|           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **< WIL** | Reduce the remaining **Spore Infestation** from your current **WIL**.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **= WIL** | You gain a **[Mutation](../#sepsis-mutations)** (roll a ***d400***). The Mutation takes a *permanent* **Burden** slot.                                                                                                    |
| **> WIL** | You develop a **Cultural Stigma** that goes away when your **WIL** is fully recovered. If you already had a **Cultural Stigma** your lungs fill with snot and you choke. You feel the ether call and become **Deprived**. |
