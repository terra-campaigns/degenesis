# Panic & Stress

- A character that is surrounded by enemies, enveloped by darkness, or facing their greatest fears may experience _panic_. A **WIL** **save** is typically required to avoid losing control and becoming _panicked_.
- When you *panic*, the GM may ask you what uncontrollable reaction you take.
- A _panicked_ character must make a **WIL** **save** to overcome their condition as an **action** on their **turn**. Alternatively, a _panicked_ character may take d6 **Stress**, reducing their **WIL**, to overcome their condition.
- A _panicked_ character has 0 **HP**, does not act in the first round of combat, and all of their attacks are _impaired_.
