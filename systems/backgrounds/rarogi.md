flavour_text: The Rarogi carved their city from barren rock, a testament to their ancestors' will, but the Biokinetics' Sepsis turned it into a poisoned wasteland. Driven underground, they fortified the Founders' Square, vowing to preserve their heritage against the tide of decay. In the shadow of ruin, they endure, defiant and unyielding, their will forged into iron.

    name: LIVING FUNGICIDE
    flavour:
      - "The Rarogi breathe death and endure. Their lungs bear the spores of Sepsis, a daily burden scoured away with bitter EX and ancient herbs, the ritual as natural to them as breathing. Where others falter, the Rarogi thrive, their bodies hardened, their resilience unmatched — a living defiance against Sepsis. "
    rule:
      - "When you take Spore Infestation, the GM rolls a smaller die."
  - roll: 2
    name: BRAINWAVE
    flavour:
      - "Riddles churn in his mind, a relentless storm of doubt and deliberation. Yet, in the chaos, a brainwave sparks — a fleeting clarity cutting through the thicket of confusion, illuminating a path forward. In the darkest scenarios, the Brainwave is his beacon, a moment of genius amidst the tumult.  "
    rule:
      - Gain **Fatigue**. You may attempt at a task with only one of the three factors (training, tools, time). If you fail, the consequences are disastrous.
  - roll: 3
    name: DANGER SENSE
    flavour:
      - "Everything is a threat, every shadow a potential foe. Skittish and tense, he flinches at even friendly gestures, ever-alert and on edge. Yet, his paranoia sharpens his instincts, making him a vigilant sentinel when danger truly strikes.  "
    rule:
      - You always win Initiative rolls.
  - roll: 4
    name: NUMBER CRUNCHER
    flavour:
      - "The world unfolds as a web of patterns, a matrix of logic and numbers. He sees the unseen connections, distilling complexity into clarity, where others see only chaos. To him, everything is a code, waiting to be solved."
    rule:
      - You always succeed and perform faster and better than anyone else in mathematics and logic.
  - roll: 5
    name: ETHER CALL
    flavour:
      - "Beyond the limits of sound, beyond the world of flesh and bone, the ether hums. Chakras resonate in its currents, and brain waves flutter like distant echoes. The spore-infested open the gate to this unseen world, where emotions ripple through the ether, intoxicating those who know how to listen."
    rule:
      - While suffering from Sepsis Infestation, you can feel the presence of other spore-infested people and Psychonaults.
  - roll: 6
    name: ELEPHANT SKIN
    flavour:
      - "Sandstorms and cold winds have carved their marks into your skin. Flesh has torn a hundred times, scabbing over into tough, knotted scars. It isn’t pretty, but it’s hard as hell to cut through."
    rule:
      - "Gain +1 Armour (to the limit of 3)."
