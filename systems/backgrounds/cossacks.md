flavour_text: The steppe is wide, brutal, and unforgiving—but so are the Cossacks. Out here, where the wind howls like a wounded beast and the horizon stretches endlessly, they reign supreme, born of a land that knows no mercy. The Cossacks don’t just survive—they thrive, their blood thick with the cold steel of defiance and their hearts bound to the untamed wilderness.

potentials:

    name: ELEPHANT SKIN
    flavour:
      - "Sandstorms and cold winds have carved their marks into your skin. Flesh has torn a hundred times, scabbing over into tough, knotted scars. It isn’t pretty, but it’s hard as hell to cut through."
    rule:
      - "Gain +1 Armour (to the limit of 3)."
  - roll: 2
    name: ASCETICISM
    flavour:
      - "Lichen, beetles, leather strips—none of it matters. Hunger gnaws, but it never consumes you. Dew from stones is a feast. Anything edible, no matter how foul, is swallowed down without a second thought."
    rule:
      - You don't become deprived due to lack of water or food.
  - roll: 3
    name: ETHER CALL
    flavour:
      - "Beyond the limits of sound, beyond the world of flesh and bone, the ether hums. Chakras resonate in its currents, and brain waves flutter like distant echoes. The spore-infested open the gate to this unseen world, where emotions ripple through the ether, intoxicating those who know how to listen."
    rule:
      - While suffering from Sepsis Infestation, you can feel the presence of other spore-infested people and Psychonaults.
  - roll: 4
    name: MARATHON
    flavour:
      - "Keep going. One step after another. The body is a machine—muscle, bone, and will—and this machine doesn’t stop. It never tires, it never falters. One destination, one purpose. Forward."
    rule:
      - When travelling, you can take an additional Crawl Action (Travel, Explore or Supply) per day.
  - roll: 5
    name: SLEEK
    flavour:
      - "The crowd cheers, thinking it’s just a show—his body bending, joints popping in ways that make them wince. But this isn’t just entertainment. These contortions were learned in darker places, for darker purposes."
    rule:
      - Gain **Fatigue**. You can evade a grapple, being stuck, bound or chained.
  - roll: 6
    name: COULD BE WORSE
    flavour:
      - "Bruises fade, cuts close, and bones mend. Pain is a warning, not a weakness. The character feels it, acknowledges it—but never lets it stop them. Pain exists to protect, not to prevent survival."
    rule:
      - When you suffer **Critical Damage** the worst result you look up on the Wound Table is a 6.
