|    ![06-CULT-SCRAPPERS-WHITE-ON-BLACK-320x320](../../imgs/icons/06-CULT-SCRAPPERS-WHITE-ON-BLACK-320x320.webp)    | **[SCRAPERS](scrapers.md)**<br>Drawn towards the ruins, away from the humming, raucous cities, Scrappers dig in the dust and dirt. Every cut of the spade brings them closer to the era of the ancient people. They work tirelessly, digging all the way down until they can drag technical wonders caked with soot into the light of day.                                                            |
|   ![01-CULT-SPITALIANS-WHITE-ON-BLACK-320x320](../../imgs/icons/01-CULT-SPITALIANS-WHITE-ON-BLACK-320x320.webp)   | **[SPITALIANS](spitalians.md)**<br>Mankind’s last line of defence against the Primer and its spawn. Spitalians explore the spore fields, dissect dead Psychonauts, and develop poisons and weapons. With their fungicides they cut swathes into the Sepsis, and carry spore covered muscles in glass tubes to lead them to the Aberrants’ breeding grounds.                                           |
|  ![12-CULT-ANABAPTISTS-WHITE-ON-BLACK-320x320](../../imgs/icons/12-CULT-ANABAPTISTS-WHITE-ON-BLACK-320x320.webp)  | **[ANABAPTISTS](anabaptists.md)**<br>The land was once beautiful and full of trees. The sun shone down with a friendly face upon fields and happy people. But today, Paradise is rotten. The Spawn of the Demiurge, Psychonauts in all their carnality carry no divine soul. The root of all evil is clear to see and must be hacked to pieces and cut out by the Anabaptists.                        |
| ![11-CULT-APOCALYPTICS-WHITE-ON-BLACK-320x320](../../imgs/icons/11-CULT-APOCALYPTICS-WHITE-ON-BLACK-320x320.webp) | **[APOCALYPTICS](apocalyptics.md)** <br>They live a pure and unbridled life. They appear in Flocks, swooping into gambling dens and nesting in bordellos. Their distillate is stronger, their Burn more potent, their whores more beautiful. Any vice finds a welcome home with them. They live in the present. All emotions are sacred to them and equally celebrated as if they were the last.      |
|     ![05-CULT-CLANNERS-WHITE-ON-BLACK-320x320](../../imgs/icons/05-CULT-CLANNERS-WHITE-ON-BLACK-320x320.webp)     | **[COSSACKS](cossacks.md)**<br>The steppe is wide, brutal, and unforgiving—but so are the Cossacks. Out here, where the wind howls like a wounded beast and the horizon stretches endlessly, they reign supreme, born of a land that knows no mercy. The Cossacks don’t just survive—they thrive, their blood thick with the cold steel of defiance and their hearts bound to the untamed wilderness. |

Driven underground, they fortified the Founders' Square, vowing to preserve their heritage against the tide of decay. In the shadow of ruin, they endure, defiant and unyielding, their will forged into iron.       |
