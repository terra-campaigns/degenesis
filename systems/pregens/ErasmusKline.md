details:
- FAMULANCER - You are appreciated and always get food for free in the Protectorate.
- RULER - You once led a group that now opposes you, and you seek to regain their loyalty. You keep a broken sceptre from your rule.
- PHALANX - A wall of spears forms a nearly impenetrable defence, with each point aimed at the enemy. Standing shoulder to shoulder, the Spitalian joins the line, ready to draw attacks toward himself to protect his comrades. As the phalanx strengthens, any foe foolish enough to charge risks impaling themselves on their deadly formation. - **Requires 2+ close allies. Your opponent is impaired if they try to attack the formation in melee.**

gear:
- Broken sceptre (d4)
- Splayer with Mollusk (d8)
- Spitalian Suit (2 Armour against Spore Infestation)
- 200 Chronicler Drafts
- Scalpel (d6)
- Tranquillizer (3 uses)
