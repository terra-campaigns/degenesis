details:
- SCRAPER **MECHANIST** - You always scrape more raw materials when dismantling.
- ZEALOT - Your faith is challenged by a heretic who claims to have the true revelation. You clutch a sacred relic that embodies your devotion.
- TRUFFLE PIG - Skilled Scrappers uncover artefacts that make Chroniclers uneasy as they reluctantly part with their Drafts, while less fortunate Scrappers barely earn more than the scrapâ€™s worth. The best Scrappers possess an instinct, a sixth sense for finding hidden treasures and avoiding dangers in the ruins. - **Choose one kind of object (key, arrow, gold, etc.). You can sense the nearest example.**
