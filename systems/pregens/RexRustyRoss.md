details:
- SCRAPER **FOX** - You have a foxhole you can use for hiding, protection and storage.
- RULER - You once led a group that now opposes you, and you seek to regain their loyalty. You keep a broken scepter from your rule.
- RAT - Scrappers survive by avoiding trouble, but Rats among them seek it out while seamlessly blending into the crowd. They can pull off daring acts like robbing a merchant and skilfully shifting the blame to an unsuspecting bystander, disappearing into the throng with their loot unnoticed. No matter what they do, Rats always seem innocent, or at least, no one can ever prove otherwise. - **You can pull roguish acts and never be caught.**
