**Rumours**
- Altair was poisoned
- Clan Benesato has been completely absorbed into the Anabaptist Cult during the great missionary movement. Nowadays, the Clan is only a puppet of Cathedral City; its former power in the area has long since been lost.
- The Emissary Neva is the wife of the murdered Baptist Altair.

{% endcomment %}


- Eccentric, short in stature but with an athletic physique, upper 30s
- Tattoos and paraphernalia on her body (some belonging to other Cults), carries a large shield on her back
- Protects Zofia, the child of [Yelena](Yelena.md)
- Uses Bion ritualistically
- Broke her leg in an [encounter with Leperos](../../../campaigns/ConnectNikopol/StationWork2.md).
