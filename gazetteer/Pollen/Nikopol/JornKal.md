========== HIDDEN ENDS ========= {% endcomment %}

- Mollusk in his sprayer was made of a Resident's brain (who calls Rubilo and Zubilo)
- His expedition in Pollen was decimated, he is the sole survivor.
- Seems to have a wound sutured with tendons.
- Terrified of spore beasts, spiders, centipedes.
