details:
- Ravenous Swarm -Spore Beasts attack in waves of 5â€“50 when colonies overflow or resources dwindle. Lone creatures rely on ambush tactics, lurking in shadows or clinging to ceilings for surprise strikes.  
- Unstoppable Hunger - Programmed to feed, Spore Beasts drag incapacitated victims back to their nests. They strike anything within 100 meters of their colony's roots, driven by instinctive colony defense.  
- Elusive Shadows- Wandering Spore Beasts in Borca use guerrilla tactics. If spotted before striking, they retreat and wait for a perfect opportunity to ambush.
