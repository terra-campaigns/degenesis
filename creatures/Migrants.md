The true rulers of [Pollen](https://degenesis.com/world/cultures/pollen) are the Biokinetics. These Aberrants exhibit incredible shape-shifting abilities and display physical prowess that blurs the line with the supernatural. The most common forms are Migrants, Biokinetics breaking out across the plains to seed new spore fields and spread the Sepsis westwards, thus expanding their Chakraâ€™s area of influence.
