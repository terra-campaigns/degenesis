title: Husk Spider (Swarm)
role: Husk Spiders have been seen in the Stukov Desert, sometimes even in Borca. However, their home is Pollen. There, they are the vanguard when the ground thaws and a Fractal Forest comes to the surface. They attack this oasis by the hundreds of thousands, and other spiders and centipedes follow the pheromone contained in their silk.

details:
- The stench of ammonia lingers, accompanied by faint, greasy traces left by their skittering legs.
- "**Critical Damage**: Cocoons threats in silk that hardens, suffocating the target under layers of interwoven fibers (d4 infection per round)."
- "**Chakra Calls**: Swarm when spore fields or Psychonauts feel threatened."
- Nearby clicking and rustling sounds grow louder as Husk Spiders approach.
