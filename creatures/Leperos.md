#### Echoes in the Spore

The wind carried whispers of unity and salvation, wrapped in shimmering spores. He inhaled, the Burn igniting his mind, fusing him with the Primer’s rhythm. His voice became a chord in a choir of thousands, his body a vessel for vengeance as the collective’s will surged through him.

When the Burn faded, silence struck like a cruel tide. He grasped for fragments of his old life, but the isolation burned worse than any Spitalian flame. To the world, they were abominations—tools of the Primer. To him, the Leperos were salvation, each death a sacrifice for an unfathomable future.
