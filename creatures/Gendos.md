details:
- Ambush Instinct - Gendos stalk prey silently by day and terrify it with barking and growling at dusk, wearing their quarry down for a decisive night assault. They prioritize isolating victims for maximum lethality.
- Pack Tactics - When attacking, Gendos strike from all sides, targeting the largest foe to cripple resistance. The alpha coordinates, defending tactically, while the rest relentlessly focus on killing.
- Instinctive Retreat - If over half the pack dies, Gendos scatter in confusion, attacking even allies. The alpha's death leads to chaos, triggering a disorganized withdrawal.
