type: location
role: A resilient underground bastion of humanity, crucial for its rich mining of rare metals and manganese, which sustain trade and survival. Its fortified structure and disciplined militias defend against the Primer, while its isolationism shields it from exploitation. Divided into miners, warriors, and traders, its society survives under the cultural and spiritual anchor of Founders’ Square, symbolizing hope amidst decay.

details:
- The underground city resonates with the hum of ventilation fans, punctuated by the clang of metal and echoing footsteps of guards. Occasional drilling and blasting sounds from the mines form a constant industrial symphony. Above ground, the Spore Wall stands as a hostile barrier surrounding the city, with only a few fortified structures marking the surface.

## Locations

### Founder's Square

The Founders’ Square serves as a cultural and spiritual heart. It symbolizes a bygone golden age, where festivals and prayers sustain hope amid the encroaching threats, Sepsis, and dwindling external alliances. Historical tension with the Spitalians highlights a fracture caused by betrayals in the past.

### Train Station

- The station is very organised, with weapons, ammo and clean floors.
- The walls are cared for by Rarogi, making sure they have no holes and cracks from where Sepsis can spread within the building.
- The roof offers a great view of the train tracks, the city (including the water pump station and its coal-fired power plant) and the spore wall.
- There is a radio tower on the roof.

### Train depot

- Used for loading and unloading the trains.
- Has a large quarantine section.

### [Lubos](../people/FoundersBlessed/Lubos.md)' workshop

- Disorganised mess of tools and equipment, including a smelting unit, bad lighting
- Smell of oil and sweat
- Hundreds of automata to be fixed
- Visited in secret in [2594-05-08](../campaigns/ConnectNikopol/InNikopol02.md)
