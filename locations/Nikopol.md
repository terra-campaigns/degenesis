title: Nikopol
role: A resilient underground bastion of humanity, crucial for its rich mining of rare metals and manganese, which sustain trade and survival. Its fortified structure and disciplined militias defend against the Primer, while its isolationism shields it from exploitation. Divided into miners, warriors, and traders, its society survives under the cultural and spiritual anchor of Founders’ Square, symbolizing hope amidst decay.

details:
- The underground city resonates with the hum of ventilation fans, punctuated by the clang of metal and echoing footsteps of guards. Occasional drilling and blasting sounds from the mines form a constant industrial symphony. Above ground, the Spore Wall stands as a hostile barrier surrounding the city, with only a few fortified structures marking the surface.
