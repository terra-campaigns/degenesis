His father had always told him about the Incarnates: Creatures with powers straight
from hell, mighty and almost untamable in their fury. He said only Vigilantes could
fight them, confuse them with booby-traps and feints, distract them only to fire salvo
after salvo from the Lupara into their massive bodies.
Then, 20 years ago, Fernex had to learn that his father‘s words were not worth a
thing. The Vigilantes had found the nest of a Psychokinetic and ambushed it. The beast
tore through the group of hunters, caught bullets from the air, made eardrums rupture
and innards explode. Fernex crouched into a chasm and watched the creature chew the
meat off his father‘s bones. When everything was quiet again, he crept from his hiding
place, took his old man‘s Lupara and went north. For months. As far away as possible
from this nightmare to a place where he‘d be safe. But the nightmare didn‘t end. He
roamed around for years and studied everything remotely connected to the Aberrants.
On his errantry, he talked to Spitalians, Anabaptists and Apocalyptics and collected
every scrap of wisdom in a little book: a hunting lexicon for killing a demon.
