When Carmino came to Vivaco 10 years ago, he found the sickbay in a shambles. The
Famulancers were malnourished, the neoprene hung from the shoulders, and the way
they patched up the wounded was unacceptable and showed how poorly they were
trained. He knew that the Spital did not care much for this outpost as it was focused
mainly on the campaigns in Pollen. The status was unbearable and a waste of potential.
Carmino took the lead, cut through the ties of the management of the outpost to the
locals, organized resources and started reshaping Vivaco according to his ideas. He also
started teaching the Famulancers. Some he turned into Field Medics and sent them
to the Adriatic Basin, others had to help him in Vivaco. Carmino was a dynamic man,
his discipline, willpower and inquiring mind inspired his subordinates. The sickbay
soon became more important, Carmino gained renown far beyond the Cult and was
respected for his relentless energy. He was even offered the vacant position of Registrar
for northern Purgare, but he rejected.
He wanted to stay at the surgical table and heal wounds that other Surgeons would
have deemed beyond hope: mending torn organs, removing jammed splinters of bone
from open fractures, replacing shattered joints by prostheses. His specialty was head
surgery. Then he was appointed personal doctor of Altair the Baptist.
