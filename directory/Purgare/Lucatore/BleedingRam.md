The taproom is contorted and hard to oversee. Wooden struts and alcoves
divide the room into small parcels; nets, pelts and pennants hanging from the ceiling
obstruct the view of the room. There is junk and relics of old battles everywhere, and
tarnished medals of honor and distinctions, broken blades and armor adorn the walls.
