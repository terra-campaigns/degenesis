In comparison to the war-torn battlefields of the Adriatic
Lowlands, the area around Lucatore is a place
of unity and wealth. The immediate vicinity of the
foothills of Territorial Region III offers an enormous
amount of protection to the area, as the Hellvetics do
not tolerate any turmoil in front of their gates. There
is peace here, at least on the surface.
The last of the wild Clans have been driven away
decades ago or carried to the Adriatic Lowlands by
the Anabaptists’ missionary efforts, and the region’s
ancient families have all converted to the Neognostic
faith. The Benesato who have always been one of
the most powerful families and are based in Lucatore
have even gone one step further: almost all of the family
joined the Anabaptists – a glorious example for all
those who hesitate, if not for the Lombardi Clan.
Bergamo’s ruling family so far has withstood all
missionary efforts. Even worse, they turned Bergamo
into a haven for the Jehammedans. A shadow reaching
east, but not powerful enough to darken the beacons
of the Neognosis.
