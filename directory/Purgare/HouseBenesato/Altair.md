The man who guided the fate of the Anabaptists together
with seven brethren was born in Lucatore. Here in the
mountains, his stellar rise through the ranks of his Cult began.
For decades, he guided its fate, made history by leading
the Anabaptists onto the Adriatic battlefields, only to
negotiate the long-desired peace with his former enemies,
the Jehammedans, in the end. His efforts united his family,
the Benesato Clan, like a noose that ties together a bundle
of twigs until they finally fully merged with the Anabaptist
Cult. Finally, his Cloister came up with the recipe for the
Elysian oils.
