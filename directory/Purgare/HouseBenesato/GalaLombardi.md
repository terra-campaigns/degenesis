Gala detests the Anabaptists, hates their foolishness, their bad teeth and stinking hair.
Anabaptists are scum. Like snakes they coiled before the gates of Bergamo, hissing their
false promises. Her family, the Lombardi, have resisted the missionary efforts and spit
into the face of the emissaries. In Bergamo, an alliance with the Jehammedans grows
instead. Vespaccio, Gala‘s father and head of the Lombardi family, has told his daughter
about his plan: she is to visit [Ennio Benesato](EnnioBenesato.md) and settle down in Lucatore. With her
charms, she is to seduce the old Benesato and join both families in marriage.
