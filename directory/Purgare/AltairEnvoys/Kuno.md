**Rumours**

- The area is grazed; there are no more artefacts to be found in the ground. But there is lots of bygone mammon: coins, gold, jewellery.
- The Emissary Neva is the wife of the murdered Baptist Altair.
- The Iron Emissary Neva and the Elysian Abacus resisted the idea of a commission of investigators for fear of violating Altair’s peace of death.
- Clan Benesato has been wholly absorbed into the Anabaptist Cult during the great missionary movement. Nowadays, the Clan is only a puppet of Cathedral City; its former power in the area has long since been lost.
- The Baptist Altair had a Spitalian medical attendant he was going to visit on the morning of his death.
