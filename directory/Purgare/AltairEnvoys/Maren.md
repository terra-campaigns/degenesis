**Rumours**
- Northern Purgare is grazed; there are no more Artefacts to be found in the ground. But there are lots of bygone mammon: coins, gold, jewellery.
- Clan Benesato has been wholly absorbed into the Anabaptist Cult during the great missionary movement. Nowadays, the Clan is only a puppet of Cathedral City; its former power in the area has long since been lost.
- Every week, a caravan with goods from the Cloister in Lucatore leaves for Cathedral City. The customs books in Roppen (in Hellvetica territory) could tell what kind of goods they are.
