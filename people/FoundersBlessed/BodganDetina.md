- Believes he is being played by [Prokhor](Prokhor.md) and the Streltsys (as suggested by [Sasha Volkov](../ProtectorateClique/SashaVolkov.md) in [Nikopol](../../locations/Nikopol.md) on [2594-05-08](../../campaigns/ConnectNikopol/InNikopol02.md)).
- Ex-Streltsys
- Smells like booze.
- Wants Nikopol to become the 6th Destruction Fortress, to conquer the Rus-Land.
