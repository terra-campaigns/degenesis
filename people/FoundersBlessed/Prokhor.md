### Just Journal entries

> **Entry 94: 2nd April 2594** Nearly a month has passed since Postachi scouts began vanishing. Survivors who returned to The Station refuse to leave, and the railroad is crippled. With the Elders placing a bounty, [Jorn](JornKal.md) steps forward. Jorn’s plan is as bold as it is dangerous. He gathers metal from Servicers, gunpowder and Piercers from Shtukars, and liters of antimycotics from the tanks. The strategy: poison a spore field to lure out the Biokinetic responsible for the disappearances and ambush it. Most pieces are set, but Jorn needs warriors, and the gamble is high. The spore-fields may yet claim more lives before the aberrant is stopped.
