### Just Journal entries

> **Entry 94: 2nd April 2594** Nearly a month has passed since Postachi scouts began vanishing. Survivors who returned to The Station refuse to leave, and the railroad is crippled. With the Elders placing a bounty, Jorn steps forward. Jorn’s plan is as bold as it is dangerous. He gathers metal from Servicers, gunpowder and Piercers from Shtukars, and liters of antimycotics from the tanks. The strategy: poison a spore field to lure out the Biokinetic responsible for the disappearances and ambush it. Most pieces are set, but Jorn needs warriors, and the gamble is high. The spore-fields may yet claim more lives before the aberrant is stopped.
