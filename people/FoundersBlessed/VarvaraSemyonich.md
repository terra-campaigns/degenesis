details:
- "**The TRAVELER** is a restless soul, forever seeking growth through the vast tapestry of the world and its people, sharing stories and news as he forges connections between the isolated and the civilized. Each step along the road fuels his longing for the next, carrying both joy and despair to those he meets. **When the road offers no new horizons, how do you forge a path into the unknown?**"
- "**KOPACHI**: You know the maze of Nikopol's tunnels damn well."
- "BRAINWAVE: Riddles churn in his mind, a relentless storm of doubt and deliberation. Yet, in the chaos, a brainwave sparks â€” a fleeting clarity cutting through the thicket of confusion, illuminating a path forward. In the darkest scenarios, the Brainwave is his beacon, a moment of genius amidst the tumult. *Gain **Fatigue**. You may attempt at a task with only one of the three factors (training, tools, time). If you fail, the consequences are disastrous.*"
