details:
- COSSACK **SCOUT** - Everyone in yours and neighbour clans knows you.
- DESTROYER - You were once a builder, but a great loss has driven you to tear down everything you once loved. You carry a hammer symbolic of your destructive path.
- COULD BE WORSE - "Bruises fade, cuts close, and bones mend. Pain is a warning, not a weakness. The character feels it, acknowledges it—but never lets it stop them. Pain exists to protect, not to prevent survival." - When you suffer **Critical Damage** the worst result you look up on the Wound Table is a 6.

gear:
- Sledgehammer (d8)
- Flintlock pistol (d8)
- 150 Chronicler Drafts
- Survival Knife (d6)
- Rope and Grappling Hook (d4)
