- DESTROYER - You were once a builder, but a great loss has driven you to tear down everything you once loved. You carry a hammer symbolic of your destructive path.
- COULD BE WORSE - "Bruises fade, cuts close, and bones mend. Pain is a warning, not a weakness. The character feels it, acknowledges itâ€”but never lets it stop them. Pain exists to protect, not to prevent survival." - **Gain Fatigue. When you fail your STR save against Critical Damage, you don't get an injury from the Wound Table.**

- Sledgehammer (d8)
