details:
- SCRAPER **MECHANIST** - You always scrape more raw materials when dismantling.
- "**The ZEALOT** burns with unwavering devotion, drawing strength from a faith so fierce it scorches everything in its path. He endures suffering and sacrifices all for his religion or ideology, proving his worth through relentless acts of belief. **When the fire consumes all but your faith, what will remain to guide you?**"
- TRUFFLE PIG - Skilled Scrappers uncover artefacts that make Chroniclers uneasy as they reluctantly part with their Drafts, while less fortunate Scrappers barely earn more than the scrapâ€™s worth. The best Scrappers possess an instinct, a sixth sense for finding hidden treasures and avoiding dangers in the ruins. - **Choose one kind of object (key, arrow, gold, etc.). You can sense the nearest example.**

gear:
- Sacred Relic
- Toolkit
- 100 Chronicler Drafts
