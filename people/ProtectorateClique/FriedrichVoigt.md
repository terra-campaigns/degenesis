details:
- "**The CREATOR** defies the inevitable decay of all things, driven to craft enduring monuments that preserve their name and legacy against the sands of time. They work tirelessly to master the grandest challenges, whether building monoliths, fortifying villages, or rekindling the Stream, each creation a testament to their worth. **What compels you to keep building when the world itself seems intent on erasing everything?**"
- "**The ADVENTURER** is a restless soul, forever chasing the edge of the map and the thrill of the unknown, where fear is not an enemy but a trusted ally. For them, the dull weight of routine is a death knell, and only in the shadow of forgotten ruins and the depths of uncharted passages do they feel alive. **What drives you forward when the ruins are silent and the darkness offers no answers?**"
- "**SURGEON**: You are well regarded by the Anabaptists. <br>"
- "**PHALANX:**Â A wall of spears forms a nearly impenetrable defence, with each point aimed at the enemy. Standing shoulder to shoulder, the Spitalian joins the line, ready to draw attacks toward himself to protect his comrades. As the phalanx strengthens, any foe foolish enough to charge risks impaling themselves on their deadly formation. *Requires 2+ close allies. Your opponent is impaired if they try to attack the formation in melee.*"

gear:
- 550 Chronicler Drafts

{% include statblock_pc.md %}

- Godfather of [Konrad Jager](KonradJager.md), old friend of his father: no kids, so treated Konrad like a son he would spoil when he was a kid - gave him interesting gifts & encouraged him to be a good [Spitalian](../../systems/backgrounds/spitalians.md).
- Travel alone across Pollen to seek out information about The Primer through what has been recorded in texts rather than from direct experiment / contact.
- Helps those in medical need.
- Had found some menacing information about the HIVE research group, and had it cryptographed with the help of the [Kievan](../../locations/Kiev.md) Chronicler.


{% comment %}

- Read this 2 paragraphs: [Vasco](https://degenesis.com/world/bio/spitalians/vasco "https://degenesis.com/world/bio/spitalians/vasco")
- Based on them, I think you met Vasco around 10 years ago. He explained his theory (on the link above) and gave you an encrypted tome that was the base of his research. You believed in him.
- You went to Kiev to ask the Chronicler to help you decrypt the tome. He told you that only in the Cluster (the protectorate) would have the key.
- A couple of years ago you were going to the protectorate, (and took Konrad with you), but some high rank Spitalians approached you. To make sure the tome survived, you gave it to Konrad but you were delayed and the 2 of you lost each other.
- You followed the tracks of Konrad until Pollen, knowing he joined the Clique.
- Then you learned about the idea that Nikopol helped Vasco at some point, and it just makes sense that you go to Nikopol now. You ask that to the Spitalian leadership and they agree (as per your point 1)
