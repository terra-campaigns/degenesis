details:
- "**The CREATOR** defies the inevitable decay of all things, driven to craft enduring monuments that preserve their name and legacy against the sands of time. They work tirelessly to master the grandest challenges, whether building monoliths, fortifying villages, or rekindling the Stream, each creation a testament to their worth. **What compels you to keep building when the world itself seems intent on erasing everything?**"
- "**The ADVENTURER** is a restless soul, forever chasing the edge of the map and the thrill of the unknown, where fear is not an enemy but a trusted ally. For them, the dull weight of routine is a death knell, and only in the shadow of forgotten ruins and the depths of uncharted passages do they feel alive. **What drives you forward when the ruins are silent and the darkness offers no answers?**"
- "**SURGEON**: You are well regarded by the Anabaptists. <br>"
- "**PRESERVALIS**: Preservists are relentless, never giving their enemies a chance to surrender. Trained in a brutal technique known as Preservalis, they strike with their sword to create an opening, then follow up with a point-blank pistol shot to ensure the kill. The recoil propels them out of reach, leaving their foes defenceless. *Requires dual wielding a **Sword** and a **Pistol**. You may disengage after a melee attack.*"

- Godfather of [Konrad Jager](KonradJager.md), old friend of his father: no kids, so treated Konrad like a son he would spoil when he was a kid - gave him interesting gifts & encouraged him to be a good [Spitalian](../../systems/backgrounds/spitalians.md).
- Travel alone across Pollen to seek out information about The Primer through what has been recorded in texts rather than from direct experiment / contact.
- Helps those in medical need.
- Had found some menacing information about the HIVE research group, and had it cryptographed with the help of the [Kievan](../../locations/Kiev.md) Chronicler.
