DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS COMMENT

Isolde was a troublemaker as a youth and did not care much for the religious indoctrination of the Anabaptists. But, her bare faced resistance to their propaganda started making waves and she found more and more support among Anabaptists who wanted a more free and fair existence. They decided instead of killing her and making a martyr of her, to make an example of her instead: When they arrested her and she asked "What gives you the right to treat people this way!?" shouting over the top of her lungs, they answered in kind, not words. They "treated" her in an operation that muddied her memory and personality and made her an obedient drone, a tool for their use and abuse. And when she started blabbering on about a "mysterious man that had answers she sought", they went along with her delirious fantasies and gave her a tome. Within its pages was cryptic nonsense and mathematical equations and drawings of things that don't exist, just to confuse her and reinforce her belief that this meeting with this mysterious man actually happened, and to further confuse her and hide the truth from her, and as an added insult.

And now, for all that she knows, she's always been a faithful Anabaptist, working for the greater good
