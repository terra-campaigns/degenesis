details:
- FAMULANCER - You are appreciated and always get food for free in the Protectorate.
- "**The RULER** is a master of order, wielding control as both shield and blade to tame the chaos of a disobedient world. They bear the burden of leadership, holding tight to the reins of power and making decisions that others dare not, fearing the ruin that delegation might bring. **When the weight of control becomes too great, who is the only one you will trust?**"
- PHALANX - A wall of spears forms a nearly impenetrable defence, with each point aimed at the enemy. Standing shoulder to shoulder, the Spitalian joins the line, ready to draw attacks toward himself to protect his comrades. As the phalanx strengthens, any foe foolish enough to charge risks impaling themselves on their deadly formation. - **Requires 2+ close allies. Your opponent is impaired if they try to attack the formation in melee.**

- Broken sceptre (d4)
- Splayer with Mollusk (d8)
- Spitalian Suit (2 Armour against Spore Infestation)
