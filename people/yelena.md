Yelena, the Seer, is the Vostok Kin's shaman who follows the ancient ways of the Lesnje. Her wisdom and insight make her a valued advisor, often offering guidance that helps her clan navigate through difficult times. Her unique presence and enigmatic nature make her an essential yet mysterious figure within the Vostok Kin.

- Virtue: Wise and insightful, often offering guidance that helps her people.
- Flaw: Sometimes cryptic and difficult to understand, her visions can be vague.
- Problem: Struggling to interpret the spirits' warnings about the spore fields.
- Aspect: Speaks in riddles and metaphors, often staring into the distance as if seeing another world.
- Idiosyncrasy: Wears a cloak made of feathers and bones, with markings that symbolize her spiritual journeys.
