# Degenesis

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a [Jekyll] site that:

- uses the [Just the Docs] theme;
- can be built and published on [GitHub Pages];
- can be built and previewed locally, and published on other platforms.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem;
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages.

After completing the creation of your new site on GitHub, update it as needed:

## Replace the content of the template pages

Update the following files to your own content

## Changing the version of the theme and/or Jekyll

Simply edit the relevant line(s) in the `Gemfile`.

## Adding a plugin

The Just the Docs theme automatically includes the [`jekyll-seo-tag`] plugin.

To add an extra plugin, you need to add it in the `Gemfile` *and* in `_config.yml`. For example, to add [`jekyll-default-layout`]:

- Add the following to your site's `Gemfile`:

  ```ruby
  gem "jekyll-default-layout"
  ```

- And add the following to your site's `_config.yml`:

  ```yaml
  plugins:
    - jekyll-default-layout
  ```

Note: If you are using a Jekyll version less than 3.5.0, use the `gems` key instead of `plugins`.

## Publishing your site on GitHub Pages

1.  If your created site is `YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-SITE-NAME`, update `_config.yml` to:

    ```yaml
    title: YOUR TITLE
    description: YOUR DESCRIPTION
    theme: just-the-docs

    url: https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-SITE-NAME

    aux_links: # remove if you don't want this link to appear on your pages
      Template Repository: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-SITE-NAME
    ```

2.  Push your updated `_config.yml` to your site on GitHub.

3.  In your newly created repo on GitHub:
    - go to the `Settings` tab -> `Pages` -> `Build and deployment`, then select `Source`: `GitHub Actions`.
    - if there were any failed Actions, go to the `Actions` tab and click on `Re-run jobs`.

## Building and previewing your site locally

See [Testing your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).

### Deprecated

If you want to localhost the website for testing purposes, you need to install jekyll ([instructions for macOS](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/)). After doing so, navigate to the repository folder and execute the following commands;

```
echo '3.1.3' >> .ruby-version
gem install bundler jekyll
bundle install
```

Assuming [Jekyll] and [Bundler] are installed on your computer:

1.  Change your working directory to the root directory of your site.

2.  Run `bundle install`.

3.  Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build your site and preview it at `localhost:4000`.

    The built site is stored in the directory `_site`.

and then browse to http://localhost:4000.

## Connected to links (manual)

Using the `Connected_to` feature requires running a script to map pages interlinks, and generate the `_data/markdown_links.json`file.
To do so as a command line to run the script while building locally, making sure you update the links often.

```
python3 extract_links.py .
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
