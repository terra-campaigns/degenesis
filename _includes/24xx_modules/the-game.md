# The Game

## Player Goal

Players aim to advance their PCs through their cult's ranks.
Treasure is not a goal in itself, but only a tool.
Having favours to collect, allies and knowing secrets is worth more than money.

## Game Flow

Players elect one of their PCs (if they have multiple).
Inactive PCs are in day-to-day Cult duties.

Play moves freely between planning, action, and consequences, all woven naturally.
Characters move through the world following their agendas, duties, and impulses.
Some actions happen quickly - **Montages** of daily life, intrigue, and preparation - while others are **Focused Scenes**.

### Montages

Players state what their characters pursue, openly or privately, and the GM resolves outcomes through narration, negotiation and dice when needed.

### Focused Scenes

Whenever an action becomes tense, risky, or emotionally charged, the table shifts into specific actions - blow by blow if needed.

### Progression

After each *in-game month*, the group checks whether the consequences are significant enough to shift a character’s Skills, Performance Deviations, or MPF (Memetic Propagation Forecast).

Climbing ranks within a Cult depends on reaching certain combinations of Aptitude and MPF, but those thresholds are met only through the flow of play: through what characters attempt, what they survive, and what they sacrifice.
