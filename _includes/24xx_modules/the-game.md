# The Game

## Intention

- Inner and outer cult intrigue to create hooks for adventure.
- Collaboration between PCs and NPCs, allowing for backstabbing and PvP.
- Goal-driven sessions focusing on small-scale roleplay.
- Rules light hack, leveraging characteristics of the original game.

## Player Goal

Players aim to advance their PCs through their cult's ranks.
Treasure is not a goal in itself, but only a tool.
Having favours to collect, allies and knowing secrets is worth more than money.

## Game Loop

The Game runs in 3 phases: **Montages**, **Interventions** and **Progressions**.

### Montage

Happens in PbP in Discord and lasts a month in-game time.
Each player elects one of their PCs (if they have multiple) to be active for a given montage.
Inactive PCs are in day-to-day Cult duties.

PCs interact with the world and play the intrigue game.
Time flows fast, and scenes are just quick montages.
Players declare their actions in private to the GM, who rolls any required dice and narrates outcomes in a **Montage** channel.
Everyone is allowed to react openly to the consequences.

### Intervention

During **Montages**, certain things require an in-session resolution.
We use the pre-scheduled sessions for that.
In a session, players roll all dice.

### Progression

At the end of a **Montage** or **Intervention**, players discuss with the GM if they have done enough to trigger **Progressions**.
*Aptitudes*, *Performance Deviations* or *MPF (Memetic Propagation Forecast)* may change through **Progressions**.
Certain levels of *Aptitude* and *MPF* are required to climb up ranks in a **Cult**.
