# Rules

## Play

Players describe what they do.
The GM advises when their action is impossible, demands a cost or extra steps, or presents a risk.
Players can revise their plans before committing to a change in goals or stakes.
Only roll to avoid risk.

## Rolling

Roll a ***skill*** die — d6 by default, higher with a relevant ***skill***, or d4 if hindered by injury or circumstances.
If helped by circumstances, roll an extra d6; if aided by an ally, they roll their ***skill*** die and share the risk.
Take the highest die.

|         |                                                                                                          |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1-2** | **Disaster**. Suffer the full risk. <br>GM decides if you succeed at all.<br>If you risk death, you die. |
| **3-4** | **Setback**. A lesser consequence or partial success.<br>If you risk death, you’re injured.              |
| **5+**  | **Success**. The higher the roll, the better.                                                            |

If success can’t get you what you want (you make the shot, but it’s bulletproof!), You’ll at least get useful info or set up an advantage.

### Defence & harm

Say how your armour or weapon breaks to turn a hit into a brief hindrance.
A broken gear is useless until it is repaired.
Injuries take time and/or medical attention to heal.

If killed, make a new character to be introduced ASAP.
Favour inclusion over realism.

## Gear

You can carry all the narratively appropriate gear.
Some items are *Bulky*.
You can only comfortably carry one *Bulky* item.
A second item *Hinders* you.
Three or more is impossible in most circumstances.

## Change

Throughout the game, you will change.
You may acquire skills and potentials.
You may become long-term injured or infected.
Most changes are treated narratively first, then dice may be rolled.

### Skill Increase

When the fiction dictates (and the GM agree), players may roll their Skill die to check for a Skill increase.
If they roll the max, the skill increases.

### MPF Change

To increase an MPF, players need to roll **higher** than their current value on a d6.
Conversely, to decrease it, they need to roll **lower** than the value.

## Uncertainty

If something is uncertain and the rules do not support its resolution, **consider the odds and roll a die**.
