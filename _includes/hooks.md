## Open hooks

I am compiling a list of current hooks we have open for my own sanity. It might also be good to reming you of what you *can* do. If anyone remembers something else, please let me know.

- Continue function to support **the Zemlyaks** (miners and lifeblood of Nikopol): Connect with [Bodgan "**Detina**"](https://terra-campaigns.github.io/degenesis/people/FoundersBlessed/BodganDetina/).
- Change function to support **the Woyins** (guardians of Nikopol). Connect with [**Prokhor**](https://terra-campaigns.github.io/degenesis/people/FoundersBlessed/Prokhor/).
- Change function to support **the Postachi** (traders and emissaries) Connect with **Orest**.
- Journal pocketed by Anastasia, with [entry about a plan from Jorn](https://terra-campaigns.github.io/degenesis/people/FoundersBlessed/Prokhor/#just-journal-entries).
- Decrypt the tome on Konrad's possession, [encrypted by the Kievan Chronicler](https://terra-campaigns.github.io/degenesis/campaigns/ConnectNikopol/InNikopol01/#friedrich-voigts-tome).
- Engage with Sokolov's Burn supply chain, and help get his hit (what for?).
- Get access to a computer (Kievan Chronicler?) to read the drive [Anastasia picked up from Lubos](https://terra-campaigns.github.io/degenesis/people/FoundersBlessed/Prokhor/#just-journal-entries)
