# Character Creation

1. If you are creating a new party, define a cohesive group concept with the other players.
1. Make a copy of the [Character Sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terra-campaigns/degenesis.test/refs/heads/main/systems/template_pc.md) for your use.
2. Roll or choose your [Background](#backgrounds). Use the tables on each background.
3. Roll or choose your [Bond](#bonds).
4. Roll 3d6 for each [Attribute](#attributes). You can swap two values.
5. Roll 1d6 for your [Hit Protection](#hit-protection).

Alternatively, roll one of the [pre-generated characters](pregens/).
