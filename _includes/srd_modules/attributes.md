# Attributes

Each of the three **Attributes** are used in different circumstances. (See **Saves**, below).

- **Strength (STR)**: Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting heavy things, bending and breaking, resisting poison, endurance, stamina etc.
- **Dexterity (DEX)**: Used for saves requiring poise, speed, reflexes, wits, coolness, sneaking, balancing, using complex tech etc.
- **Willpower (WIL)**: Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, manipulate unknown powers, dealing with heavy intellectual activities etc.

**Attributes** are not universal descriptors. A character with a low STR is not necessarily hopelessly weak; they can still attempt to lift a heavy door or survive a deadly fight! Their risk is simply higher.

## Attribute Loss

Attributes may be reduced during play.

- If a PC takes damage outside of combat, they should instead receive damage to an **Attribute**, typically **STR**. If a PC's **STR** is reduced to **0**, they die.
- **DEX** loss relates to physical harm that is not fatal, but makes you less able. When **DEX** reaches **0** you are incapacitated.
- Exertion or interacting with the Primer reduces your **WIL**. When **WIL** reaches **0**, you are broken.
