# Deprivation & Fatigue

- A PC that lacks a crucial need (such as food or rest) is **Deprived**. Anyone **Deprived** for more than a day gains a **Fatigue**, one for each day. A **Deprived** PC cannot recover HP, Attributes, or from Fatigue.
- A PC may also be forced to gain **Fatigue** after using **Potentials** or due to events occurring in the fiction. All **Fatigue** lasts until the PC is able to recuperate (such as with a full nightâ€™s rest in a safe spot).
- You are reduced to **0 HP** when your total **Fatigue** is equal or higher than your current **WIL**.
