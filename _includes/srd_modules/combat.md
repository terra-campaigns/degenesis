# Combat

## Rounds
{: .no_toc }

- A **Round** is roughly ten seconds of in-game time and and proceeds with each side taking turns. Each round starts with any PC that is able to act, followed by their opponents. _The result of each side's actions occur simultaneously_. 
- During the _first round of combat_, each PC must make a DEX save in order to act. Special circumstances, abilities, items, or skills may negate this requirement. PCs that fail their save _lose their turn_ for this round.
- Their opponents then take their turn, and the first round ends. The next round begins with the PCs taking their turn, followed by their opponents, and so on until combat has ended with one side defeated or fled.

## Actions
{: .no_toc }

On their turn, a character may move up to 40ft and take up to one action. This may be casting a spell, attacking, moving for a second time, or some other reasonable action. Each round, the PCs declare what they are doing before dice are rolled. If a character attempts something risky, the Warden calls for a save for appropriate players or NPCs. 

## Attacking & Damage
{: .no_toc }

- The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target's **Armour**, then deals the remaining total to their opponent's **HP**. Attacks in combat automatically hit.
- If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result. All actions are declared before being resolved.
- If an attack would take a PC's **HP** exactly to 0, refer to the [Scars](#scars-table) table to see how they are uniquely impacted.

## Weapons

Weapons have a damage die.

|     |                      |
| --- | -------------------- |
| d4  | **Impaired** attacks |
| d6  | **Small** weapons    |
| d8  | **Medium** weapons   |
| d10 | **Large** weapons    |
| d12 | **Enhanced** attacks |

Weapons also may have tags.

|              |                                                           |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Bulky*      | Needs 2 hands                                             |
| *Advanced*   | Ignore non-advanced Armour                                |
| *Blast*      | Harms multiple opponents (roll damage die for the number) |
| *Non-lethal* | Targets DEX after HP                                      |

For ranges, use what is narratively appropriate.

## Armours

- Shields and similar armour provide a bonus defence (e.g. +1 Armour), but only while the item is held or worn. Some may also provide additional benefits, depending on the fiction.
- A PC, NPC, or monster cannot have more than 3 Armour.  

|     |            |                                    |
| :-: | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
|  1  | **Light**  |                                    |
|  2  | **Medium** | *Bulky*.                           |
|  3  | **Heavy**  | *Bulky*, noisy, reduced awareness. |
| +1  | **Shield** | Occupies one hand.                 |
	
## Attack Modifiers
{: .no_toc }

- If fighting from a position of weakness (such as through cover or with bound hands), the attack is _Impaired_, and the attacker must roll 1d4 damage regardless of the attacks damage die. Unarmed attacks always do d4 damage.
- If fighting from a position of advantage (such as against a helpless foe or through a daring manoeuvre), the attack is _Enhanced_, allowing the attacker to roll 1d12 damage instead of their normal die.
- Attacks with the _Blast_ quality affect all targets in the noted area, rolling separately for each affected character. This can be anything from explosions to a dragonâ€™s breath or the impact of a meteorite. If unsure how many targets can be affected, _roll the related damage die for a result_.
- If attacking with two weapons at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the single highest result (denoted with a plus symbol, e.g. d8+d8).

## Critical Damage
{: .no_toc }

- Damage that reduces a target's HP below zero is subtracted _from their **STR**_ by the amount of damage remaining. The target must then immediately make a **STR** save to avoid taking **Critical Damage**, using their _new **STR** score_. On a success, the target is still in the fight (albeit with a lower **STR** score) and must continue to make critical damage saves when incurring damage.
- When a PC suffers **Critical Damage**, look up the damage die result on the Wounds Table. NPCs and monsters that fail a **Critical Damage** save may be considered dead, per the **Warden's** discretion. Additionally, some enemies have special abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a **Critical Damage** save.

## Character Death
{: .no_toc }

- When a character dies, the player should create a new character or take control of a hireling. They immediately join the party in order to reduce downtime.

## Detachments
{: .no_toc }

- Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single _Detachment_. When a _detachment_ takes **Critical Damage**, it is routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 STR, it is destroyed.
- Attacks against detachments by individuals are _impaired_ (excluding _blast_ damage). Attacks against individuals by detachments are _enhanced_ and deal _blast_ damage.

## Retreat
{: .no_toc }

- Running away from a dire situation always requires a successful DEX save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

## Ranged Attacks
{: .no_toc }

- Ranged weapons can target any enemy near enough to see the whites of their eyes. Attacks against especially distant targets are _Impaired_.
- Ammunition is not tracked unless otherwise specified.
