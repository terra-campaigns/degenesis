# Procedures

## Downtime

Between game sessions, players can engage in a variety of activities such as research, following up on leads, improving skills, or building relationships. A PC is limited to one **Downtime Action** at a time. These actions cannot be undertaken in unsafe conditions or while a character is in recovery. A character cannot perform an action if it would put their safety at risk.

### Milestones

For activities requiring multiple steps, the **Warden** assigns 1-5 **Milestones** for players to track progress. Each **Milestone** represents a comprehensive, non-interactive task. The **Warden** may present different strategies to achieve these goals, each with distinct **Milestones**. Depending on the unfolding events in the game, the **Warden** is also empowered to introduce new **Milestones** or discard existing ones.

### Costs

PCs can complete individual **Milestones** by taking a **Downtime Action** and paying its respective **Cost**. If a character is unable to pay the **Cost**, they may have to find some other way to achieve their goal. A few examples of **Cost**: 
- **Gold**: Direct payment of gold from a character's inventory.
- **Resources**: Non-monetary costs such as material goods, specific common items, and so on. 
- **Reputation**: Betting on a character's renown, personality, presence, social connections, etc.
- **Loss**: Offering something specific and unique. A finger, a soul, a **Relic**, etc.

Some **Costs** can be reduced or disregarded through character skills, connections, or force of will. For example, a PC may have already acquired the necessary reputation to gain access to a renowned institution, and thus the **cost** is abated. On the other hand, another character may not be so lucky and must rely on their force of personality instead. In this case, the Warden should state the risk (a permanent ban on entry, a loss of reputation, etc.). The PC then makes a **WIL** save; on a success, the cost is either reduced or avoided entirely. 

## Downtime Actions

The following activities represent some of the most common **Downtime Actions** a players can choose. The **Warden** can also create custom actions based on the needs of play.

### Research

A PC investigates a question about a bit of lost or forgotten lore, the location of a lost item, the whereabouts of an important NPC, and so on. To take this action, the player must have a clearly formulated question they'd like to answer and a **Source** of knowledge in the game world that their character can interact with. If the PC does not have a **Source**, then they can spend a **Downtime Action** trying to find one. There is no guarantee that they will be successful. Once a question is posed and an appropriate **Source** has been identified, the **Warden** should provide any **Milestones** and associated **Costs**. 

#### Questions

As always, the question must come from an experience that occurred during play.

**Examples:**

- "Where is the **Lost Temple of East Nipoor**?" 
- "Who in **Fortune City** might know how to crack an ancient vault?"
- "Where can I find the cure to **curly sickness**?" 

#### Sources

A **Source** is a person, place, faction, or entity that holds either a part or whole answer that the character seeks. They can be NPCs, Factions, spirits, or even other PCs. 

##### Examples: 

- **Kewr the Mouth**, a frequent contact for the **Conclave of Merchants**. Despite their excellent relationship with this faction, asking for help in an illicit activity might come at a high cost.
- A **Woodwose** who makes his home deep in the **Forest of Knives**. The party encountered him in an earlier expedition and the meeting did not end well. Still, he is said to know the nature of every herb and their healing properties.
- The **Temple of Puppets**, a nomadic circus troupe who have travelled the known and unknown lands. The party assisted one of their members during the **Rain of Fire**, when even the creatures of the Wood were preparing to flee their homes. If anyone has heard of forgotten places, it's them.

### Training

A character can improve their skills with an item or ability, with clear narrative or mechanical results. They might be interested in dealing greater damage with a particular weapon, decreasing their chances of getting lost in rough weather, or learning to read the languages of the ancients. A PC might spend multiple **Downtime Actions** sparring with a particular weapon, improving their skills week by week. Or they may need to travel to the home of a distant sage, improving themselves through short but intense study.

The player must describe precisely what they'd like to improve and a **Master** whom they might train with. And of course, the character's inspiration to improve should come from an experience in play. The **Warden** should provide any **Milestones** and associated **Costs**. 

**Examples:**

- **The Two-Handed Parry**: When fighting with one hand free, a PC's HP temporarily increases by 1d4. The party took on a hireling from the **Cratered Lands**, whose fighters emphasize avoiding enemy attacks. She has agreed to train anyone who can best her in hand to hand combat.
- **Herbology**: Given proper ingredients, a PC can create a **Healing Salve** (restores 4 STR) as a **Downtime Action**. After receiving care from an elderly herbalist in the **Verdant Glades**, the wounded PC asked to be trained in the healing arts. The **Master** has agreed, but asked that they collect three rare herbs before training can begin. 
- **Troutmaster**: When taking the Supply **Action**, **Rations** gathered near cold freshwater sources increase by one step (e.g. 1d4 becomes 1d6). The party escorted a stranded naturalist from the famously dreadful **Silver Wastes** safely back to the city. As thanks, she has offered to train a PC to identify and capture a common lakefish that frequents colder waters.

### Strengthening Ties

A character fosters a connection with an NPC or Faction in the game world. First, they must identify the entity with whom they wish to strengthen ties, as well as a specific **intent** (e.g., building trust, mending a friendship, seeking membership in a Faction, forming an alliance, and so on). The **Warden** then provides concrete measures (described as **Milestones** and **Costs**) that the PC can undertake to advance the relationship. With each completed **Milestone**, the **Warden** describes how the PC's relationship has grown or changed. 

**Examples:**

- After returning from an unsuccessful delve into the **Roots**, a PC discovers that they'd unknowingly brought along a stowaway: an eyeless devourer, barely hatched. They decide to keep the creature and train it in secret. 
- During a play session, a PC becomes friendly with an agent of the **Order of the Helm**. Impressed by the Order's values, the PC asks what the requirements are to join.
- An agent for a powerful faction dies during the **Battle of Frogs** while under the party's care. Now those responsible wish to provide redress, so that the party can once again perform tasks for that faction.
