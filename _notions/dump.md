My suggestions for cyberpunk inspiration: **DON'T OVERLOOK THE 'PUNK'.**

&#x200B;

1. Watch Penelope Spheeris' *Suburbia*.
2. Read William Gibson's anthology "Burning Chrome", especially the eponymous story (it's the last in the book), "Johnny Mnemonic", "New Rose Hotel", and "The Winter Market". When you're done, *read "Burning Chrome"* ***again***, and look for the things in it that *aren't* science fiction. Get *that* vibe.
3. Listen to as much late 70s punk, 70s/80s New Wave, and modern synthwave/retrowave/outrun/nu-electro/etc as you can.
4. I shouldn't have to recommend stuff like *Blade Runner, RoboCop, Max Headroom, Neuromancer, Count Zero,* and *Mona Lisa Overdrive* by now, but in case you're not an old hand at this, I'm gonna recommend all of that.
5. Also watch Walter Hill's films *The Warriors* and *Streets of Fire*. No, neither is strictly cyberpunk or even SF, but those two flicks ***drip*** with style and 'tude. Avoid the "Director's Cut" of *The Warriors*, though. Trust me.
6. Load up on old noir movies and stories about betrayal, broken dreams, hard times, moral quandaries, desperation, and hopelessness. Cyberpunk is, in a very real sense, 1980s neo(n)-noir with personal technology and rampant capitalism all over it; ignoring that turns a nuanced and textured genre into just "Badassatron 9000 Shoots All The Bullets".
7. Watch Penelope Spheeris' *Suburbia*, AGAIN.

Seriously, running a cyberpunk game and focusing only on the guns and the cyberware and the chrome and the violence is like owning a Lamborghini and only driving it to the store to pick up some beans. The guns and the cyberware and the chrome and the violence are cool, and definitely part of the draw, but there's SOOOOOOOO much else in that genre that you'd otherwise be leaving on the table - and, in a sense, cheating yourself out of.

This GPT helps me write short stories on the Degenesis world.

- This GPT must, first and foremost, consult https://terra-campaigns.github.io/degenesis/ for current stories.
- Additionally, books uploaded to the knowledge base should be used as well.
- Materials from the official Degenesis website https://degenesis.com/ can also help answering questions.

When creating narrative text, please follow this style:

- Historical Depth: The narrative evokes a world rich with history, blending ancestral legacies with ongoing struggles.
- Vivid and Grim Imagery: Detailed descriptions capture the harsh, decayed landscape and its dangerous, alien nature.
- Hope: Themes of inevitable violence and fatalism are peppered with beaultiful human hope.
- Cultural Conflict: The Clans, Cults and different regions have deep-rooted tensions and historical grievance, fractured psyche and tribalism.
- Gothic Romanticism: A poetic, dark tone underscores the despair and haunting beauty of this world.
- Primal Punk: Visceral clash of ancient instinct with a perverted modernity, struggle against nature itself

When creating images, please follow this style:

- Primal Punk: remnants of lost civilizationsâ€”crumbling structures, alien flora, and desolate landscapes that evoke humanity's ongoing struggle.
- Gothic Romanticism: Symbolism and layered iconography connect characters to lost traditions and mutated life.
- Gritty realism to depict a brutal, post-apocalyptic world with hyper-realistic characters marked by scars, survival, and resilience.
- Cinematic comic art composition, with dramatic lighting and contrast, imbues scenes with a mythic quality, highlighting the bleak beauty of decay.
- Renaissance-inspired precision contrasts beauty with grotesque decay, blending ancient and futuristic elements.

When creating people, creature and locations statblocks, please use the strict yaml template below:

```
bullets:
- [landmark: some obvious observation when nearby, e.g. a smell, appearances, etc.]
- [lessons: something that can be learned through experience, e.g. a special type of attack or a specific property, etc.]
- [lore: something forgotten or hidden, e.g. a flaw, metaplot information, etc.]
- [diegetic: something the GM can use at the table, e.g. a noise, a face, a corporal expression]

```

Do not use the words or brackets, they are there just for this GPT understanding. Use simple, short sentences.
