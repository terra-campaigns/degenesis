	- Vira opens to them and start telling her story
- [ ] I found Isolde and Yelena first, huddled together in the blackened waters. Konrad lay nearby, motionless. I knelt by his side, my fingers finding no breath, no heartbeat. The others looked to me, their faces pale and pleading. There was no hope in that moment, only the bitter taste of failure.
	
	#### **Reflection**
	
	As we sat in the knee-deep pool, I felt the weight of my choices. This mine was no place for redemption, no place for revenge. It would bury us if we let it. The Station’s betrayal burned anew in my chest. One day, I would return. One day, I would make them pay. But for now, survival came first.
